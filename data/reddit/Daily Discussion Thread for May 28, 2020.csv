&#x200B;

>The draft version of the order, which could change, specifically namechecks Facebook, Google, and Twitter and targets a section of US law that means tech platforms broadly aren't legally responsible for what their users post, and are fairly free to police content. Trump is expected to sign the order on Thursday.  
>  
>Specifically, the order requires the FCC to examine regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which means online platforms aren't broadly liable for their users' posts and gives them scope on policing inappropriate content. The order asks the FCC to look at whether actions to remove or alter user content means platforms would forgo these protections.

The White House administration decided not to publish economic projections over the summer, thus breaking off the practice for the first time in almost 50 years, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing three unnamed insiders familiar with the matter.

After proposing the federal budget in February, the United States government usually releases a ""mid-session review"" during the summer months that includes updates of economic projections in areas such as unemployment, inflation and growth. One of the sources claimed that the omission of the forecasts in the document was due to the difficulty in assessing the COVID-19 pandemic's exact impact on the economy.

The report notes that the review's intended release date would be just ahead of November's presidential election, hinting that the fact may have had a role in opting to exclude the statistical updates from the document.",t3_gs3jqo,7

It was showing that my August $115c bid ask was really low, and trying to force a limit sell of around $80.  But it should have been twice that.

Well, guess what? I put in a limit sell at nearly twice the price and it filled.  And it was STILL LOWER than what it was worth.
