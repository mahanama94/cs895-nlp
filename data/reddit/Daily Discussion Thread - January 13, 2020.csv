Today we traded exactly as crayon trendlines projected, [as seen here on the hourly chart.](https://imgur.com/ADiXSlC) As such, tomorrow we're likely to trade within the trendlines until we get news on the trade deal Wednesday. We're nearing inflection on the PPO so my sense is that if something bad happens related to the trade deal, we break that 324.8 support and start heading downwards. If the trade deal is signed and it's to the market's satisfaction, we break the current resistance trendline and go to the next zone upwards, which is a push for 330. 

So in short, tomorrow is probably going to be quite range-bound (~328.2), likely closing around or below that number in anticipation of Wednesday. It will also be important to watch CPI-- if there's a large miss we may also head downwards, though as I've mentioned, our floor is 324.8.
