I don‚Äôt have a great explanation for what happened other than the market seems disappointed with today‚Äôs deal, though I‚Äôm not sure why. AMRS management delivered on their promise, raised a ton of new cash, improved its liquidity position, and the company‚Äôs balance sheet hasn't been cleaner in years. 50% of management's full year guidance was delivered in first quarter just from this transaction alone. New recurring manufacturing streams were solidified for the next 15 years. AMRS retained a participation interest in the non-core molecules they monetized, so they really haven't given up that much. And there is still another, smaller deal coming that we know less about

I believe in this company for the long term so still holding all shares, all long-dated options, and most of the April calls. Hard to predict where things will go from here, but I remain bullish

Cost effective and environmentally friendly. I have read about using bacteria to create opiates for example (modifying them so the bi-product of fermentation is opiates). This is unrelated to AMRS, but the fact that they have implemented this tech already and at scale is nothing short of incredible. So they can skip the incredibly expensive process of growing / processing poppies to harvest thebaine (used for pharmaceutical opiates) and cut straight to the desired outcome (I am over simplifying a little). They use AI to determine how to make the necessary modifications to get the desired outputs, and are constantly working to discover new ‚Äòrecipes‚Äô to do so. This company is so early and already executing on things that were just barely being proven as possible in studies not long ago. Saw someone post about this company in another investing sub a few days ago and after reading more put in all the free capital I had in all of my investment accounts (only about $3000 total as of right now), and have another $4k being transferred to buy more, hopefully by tomorrow or Wednesday.

1617229670.0,2021-04-02,wallstreetbets,gsysc9w,"This company kind of looks like a story of a ""cool product"" that nobody gives a fuck about.  There may be a bull thesis here but you should all understand how *insanely* risky this play is.

* They've had to dilute multiple times at this point just to stay afloat.
* The guidance they've given in the past borders on an SEC violation.
* They're currently dumping revenue streams.
* They constantly fuck over public investors with PIPEs and debt exchanges.

The bull thesis is essentially that there's enough people who give af about sharks to pay for their fancy yeast. Which, don't get me wrong, sounds like a cool af product.  The same way VR *sounded* cool af 30 years ago or EVs *sounded* cool af in the 80's.

Do you really want to gamble that *this* is the company that brings this product to market successfully or is it more likely this overvalued, revenue starved, poorly managed, diluted to oblivion shitshow is going to be raided by HFs into oblivion at which point a larger competitor will buy the company for pennies on the dollar and sit on the patents till sharks go extinct and the world actually needs their fancy yeast?

The alternatively bull thesis is that OP has done a good enough DD that this stock becomes meme'd and the injection of smooth brained money will actually allow them to start scaling and investing in worthwhile management (see GME hiring former AMZN execs.)

GME has had the good sense to not dilute and bend over and PIPE their public shareholders.  Imagine if that goodwill didn't exist between GME management and WSB smooth brains who saved their jobs and you've got this company.",t3_mfc86c,1

The company didn't really turn around until 3Q 2020 - November of last year was the inflection point. 4Q 2020 earnings were an absolute blowout - look at the market reaction. Earnings call transcripts are very telling, I recommend reading them if you have time. They also don't have much in the way of real equity research coverage, so the quality of the estimates is suspect. More to the point - this isn't a business that can be benchmarked on EPS (yet) - it's still an early stage growth company and earnings predictability is challenging, which the company fully acknowledges. I'd personally pay more attention to revenue and EBITDA estimates through 2021 (I expect the company to be EBITDA positive by YE 2021 and EPS positive by YE 2022, but these are just educated guesses)

On my April calls - been accumulating them over the past two weeks or so, and they've been all over the place which is par for the course with this name. AMRS trades are not well-suited for paperhands - the stock is volatile (typical for an early stage growth company)",t1_gsmwnxt,12

The shareholder lawsuits are worthless IMO, and the Lavvan lawsuit is a risk but I think it's likely to get settled out of court for a fraction of the headline number. It also only relates to cannabis which is not a significant part of AMRS's business yet - so a bit of a stretch for Lavvan to claim huge damages when their isn't much evidence to support that AMRS got much benefit from their partnership at all

On dilution - the strategic transactions mentioned in the DD are a validation of the company's business model - they generate a significant amount of up front cash as well as recurring revenues over a multi-year period. This is huge as it allows the company to raise cash from operations instead of diluting existing investors by raising new money.

Two deals are expected - they may be announced separately or concurrently. One is $500mm+ and the other is probably around $70-100mm - not many details about them are yet known

Also to note - the selling stockholder for the $150 million piece is also the same party that they just did the strategic transaction with a $150 million upfront payment. So basically, they paid AMRS $150 million and are funding it by selling $150 million of shares they own in AMRS

None of this was disclosed by management, and I'm sorry to anyone that took losses because of this post

This is very common for early stage companies, particularly in frontier technology. Developing new technologies is expensive, and there isn't always an immediately obvious business application. Trial and error has led AMRS to where it is today.

When a company doesn't generate sufficient cash flow to cover its operations, the only way to stay alive is raise new money, diluting existing shareholders. The strategic transactions they will announcing this week validate that they've finally found a business model that is sustainable and generates enough cash that they can operate their business without issuing significant dilutive equity. This is so important. Sure, it is possible, even likely that they will raise some new equity going forwards, many companies do this, but management has confirmed that the days of significant dilution are over thanks to the new transactions (as well as the cash generated from their high-margin consumer brand portfolio)",t1_gspfaa5,5

These are unrelated, but ultimately what  AMRS is doing with cannabis compounds already they can do with almost anything, and for a low cost. Once they develop the bacteria ‚Äòrecipies‚Äô, all they need is sugarcane - sugar is the main component in fermentation other than the bacteria itself.

Then they can even just license their process to become more passive as they move on to other areas.

The balance sheet has never been better, we've largely reduced DSM's overhang and influence in operating the business, we've acquired a number of brands that will be growth drivers, and a number of key catalysts are ahead:

1. [$AMRS has a webcast conference on April 22](https://investors.amyris.com/events-and-presentations?item=79) that should broaden the reach of the company's message. They've done this twice before and both times the stock rallied
2. JPM should pick up equity research coverage and put a price target on the stock - this should happen 25 days after the close of the equity offering (typical restricted period is 25 days). Assuming they have a decent price target, could be a helpful catalyst
3. Q1 earnings should be good. They first deal they announced more or less made their numbers for the entire year, not just Q1, so I anticipate Q1 will be solid
4. There is still the second transaction that needs to be announced (I guess its announcement will come concurrently with Q1 earnings, but I am only guessing)

All that being said, the market is selling off all speculative growth companies at the moment, and $AMRS has not been spared whatsoever. I do not know if any of the above items will turn the tide, but I'm hanging onto my positions for the long-haul. I may dabble in some May calls as well",t1_gv2qbgv,2

As I said, the Lavvan lawsuit is real, but it‚Äôs claims are specific to cannabis, which so far has generated almost zero revenue for AMRS.

1617035864.0,2021-04-02,wallstreetbets,gspbyq6,"I gave you a thoughtful response, but it seems that you are too retarded for your own good. I now regret wasting my time

I haven't sold a fucking share. The stock is volatile and regularly swings +/- 8% in a trading session

Before you go patting yourself on the back for spotting the ""dump"", maybe you should spend 8 seconds looking at the AMRS's trading history and you'd see that is regular price action. Volatility is the price of a shot at high returns

You might also question whether or not me selling my whole 1,000 shares (when AMRS has a float of over 239,000,000) would actually move the market...for fuck's sake",t1_gsohw4f,11

1616988163.0,2021-04-02,wallstreetbets,gsneqrs,"The latter my ape friend. It‚Äôs just a running total amount of historical losses. It never has to be repaid. Only debt on the balance sheet has to be repaid (unless it‚Äôs convertible debt which could be turned into equity). The company is trying to get below $100 million of debt by the 2nd quarter I believe which is totally healthy IMO. No doubt this is a high risk / high reward stock that is crazy volatile, but not because of the balance sheet at the moment. It ain‚Äôt for everyone, but this is WSB",t1_gsne2wh,9
1616989392.0,2021-04-02,wallstreetbets,gsngmkt,"Another complete retard. It‚Äôs okay. This company has never traded ‚Äúmuch higher in the past‚Äù. Prior to these deals being announced, their business didn‚Äôt generate enough earnings to fund their operations, so they had to raise dilutive equity to continue running the business. The technology had not aligned with a sustainable business model yet. This is extremely common with early stage growth companies. The reason the share price looks higher previously is because of reverse share splits - at no point was the stock at $500. 

This company has gone through several iterations of its model before finally finding what I believe is a genius solution - developing high-margin, high-growth consumer brands to create cash flow in the intermediate term while scaling up industrial production and developing new ingredients which are monetizing is large, bulky strategic transactions such as those that will be announced this week. 

Extremely blatantly sus? If you‚Äôre going to throw shade, at least show some basic understanding of the facts you fucking smooth brained ape",t1_gsndubp,7
