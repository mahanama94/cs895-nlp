1583941746.0,2020-03-11,wallstreetbets,fk7qlr1,"It's important to not get caught up in any single day's move.  The overall trend is down; we are in a bearish market (even if not technically a bear market yet until S&P hits 2710).

In a bear market, you get extreme 3+% up/down moves regularly, sometimes multiple moves of that magnitude a day as we've seen the past couple of weeks.  Be a nimble trader around these moves, and stay in cash if you don't like any day's move.  Take profit quickly on short-term trades because they can reverse quickly.

Finding the bottom in a bear market is a process; it requires information about the cause of the economic slowdown, which in this case requires more testing data from the CDC/local governments and information about whether the Italy/European shutdowns work to halt the extent of the spread of the coronavirus.

I still think we're 2-3 weeks away from the bottom.  The bottom will occur when markets buy even on bad news related to the coronavirus.  That can admittedly start happening at any time.  It will happen if governments start doing enough to reverse the damage that the coronavirus is causing.  But it also won't happen until we see the real extent of the US spread and whether it's containable in Europe.  This is still 2-3 weeks away in all likelihood.

Once the US reaches max acceleration in case growth, that's really where I expect to see a bottom.  But again, nobody knows when that is.",t3_fgvdtv,32

‚Ä¢ There are likely some people out here who are being overshadowed by all the gain porn: folks who've lost their ass and might be worried as fuck. My only advice is to cut your losses and don't be ashamed or afraid to ask for help, even if it's reaching out to your fellow autists. I got crushed last fall chasing losses after CRM had their earnings call early and wrecked me. First people to reach out were people here. Messages, comments, all that. Since then, I've tried to pay that forward because it meant a lot at the time.  

‚Ä¢ This is real life and this is real money, yes. We all know a thing or two about risk. That said, COVID19 is positioned to fuck us all with a Theta crush. Don't take your physical well-being or that physical well-being of your loved ones for granted: take care of yourselves.
