The addition of Ryan Cohen just makes it worse for bears because part of the bear thesis for years has been management incompetence.

Guess what. Your argument is a bad thesis at the moment. The company is making moves to improve and the share price is reflecting all the moving parts that are bullish. People were assuming YEARS ago that this current generation of consoles would be the end of discs. It wasn't. Not even close. Physical to digital console sales are 5:1

No idea what you mean by being 'completely frozen out of the consoles'. That bit doesn't even make sense. MSFT is clearly supporting GME.

Right now though the bear case has been delayed so the market is reflecting that in the rise in share price - there's enough holes in that simplified bear theory to make investors question it.  I think it could still go either way but I lean towards the Bull case due to gaming being a niche market and Microsoft giving them a line.  Both Microsoft and Sony said that the next generation consoles will still have discs as well.

Bull to your Bear

I struggle with the bull case and am too scared to jump back in; i think i'd prefer to hit the trend and ride it up a bit.

My dumb opinion is that for GameStop to grow, it has to go three routes, digital marketplace, focis on PC components and games, and distribution/same day delivery from their existing real estate, and get rid of all the retail bullshit they are doing now.

I think this reimagined GameStop fits in nicely between MicroCenter, Valve/Steam and their existing new/used retail model/bestbuy/walmart.

They have a big enough valuation and procurement power to be able to make inroads in those markets. Valve at probably around 6 bil in revenue, microcenter at 2.5 bil in revenue.

Also, the bankrupt thesis doesn't hold just by quoting other companies, you don't seem to have read their last ER so why you're telling me they are going bankrupt?

Also, you are saying that they won't break into e-commerce yet they have a strong brand already, customer base and now Ryan Cohen who successfully made it through e-commerce in a Amazon-dominated era (a company you actually quoted here).

Also, the recent (8 Jul 2020) credit upgrade by Moody's go against your thesis (from C = negative outlook to B3 = stable outlook).

Also this credit upgrade doesn't even take into account the last ER so this is bullish as well.

Also they have repaid double-digit millions $ in debts last quarter alone, do bankrupted companies even do that?

Also, if you don't have skin in the game it proves you don't have made your own DD to put your money where your month is so it just proves that you are not serious in your analysis.

I think you people are insane for betting on Gamestop. Consoles are already produced without disk drives, nobody goes to Gamestop to buy peripherals, their transition to digital is 10 years too late. If I want to buy games digitally I buy them on Steam, PSN or xbox live. Gamestop is as irrelevant now as it was last year and will crash soon once the delusion fades.

 [**ShortTheNasdaq**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ShortTheNasdaq/)

Alright short it then but good luck on that.

As I said already: 250%+ yearly growth ecom sales, already closing top \~20% of their most unprofitable locations, high margin partnership with Microsoft, new gaming console generation, Moody's recent credit upgrade, and I didn't even mentionned Ryan Cohen...

[reactbooter](https://www.reddit.com/user/reactbooter/)

Its easy to get 250% growth on ecom sales from nothing lol. You should be more worried that they have so many unprofitable locations in the first place. Them closing businesses stores means there are less opportunities for customers to buy them locally, driving even more people online and when people go online they buy at (no particular order): amazon, steam, epic, PSN, xbox live

Gamestop has nothing to attract online customers to their website. People don't even know they have a website and competition in online game sales is absolutely cut-throat vicious. Epic is there burning money handing games out left and right. Bankrupt gamestop can't do that. It's over brah.

I'm not short though. I prefer to play the moon game rather than the short game. I need that $ARCT rebound in me.

 [**ShortTheNasdaq**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ShortTheNasdaq/)

You are right in that it's easier to go up from the bottom but the momentum is strong you can't deny this. It's a fact. And with that kind of growth GameStop definitely won't go bankrupt unlike you're saying.

Also, the bankrupt thesis doesn't hold just by quoting other companies, you don't seem to have read their last ER so why you're telling me they are going bankrupt?

Also, you are saying that they won't break into e-commerce yet they have a strong brand already, customer base and now Ryan Cohen who successfully made it through e-commerce in a Amazon-dominated era (a company you actually quoted here).

Also, the recent credit upgrade by Moody's go against your thesis.

Also this credit upgrade doesn't even take into account the last ER so this is bullish as well.

Also they have repaid double-digit millions $ in debts last quarter alone, do bankrupted companies even do that?

Also, if you don't have skin in the game it proves you don't have made your own DD to put your money where your month is so it just proves that you are not serious in your analysis.

I could go on but I will just stop here because you don't seem to have enough information to hold this conversation, it's pointless to argue to the uneducated (about GME, not saying you're dumb).

1609739691.0,2020-12-27,wallstreetbets,gi1j2tr,"Good luck. Haven’t heard that companies are legally obligated to stay in businesses before...

Reasons why I think this is wrong:
(1) This DD doesn’t really factor in anything on business fundamentals and competition. Sure stores are getting profitable (says mgmt. mainly due to closing shittier stores) but the four wall margins on these stores are incredibly low as it begins and the cash generation of the business is de minimus. Effectively, the company generates no free cash flow and more recently this has been exacerbated. 

(2) This isint really a short term problem for the company. The industry is experiencing a shift and GameStop is not well positioned to compete against other online competitors, Amazon, other commoditized online marketplaces, etc. The business is battling to shift strategies and stay alive. The company has already seen operating margins decrease from 6% (already low) to negative territory and to further make my point gross margins are sub 30%! The company is on a race to restructure, gain expensive financing, buyback stock (pre covid) to keep investors happy, and cut dividends to save cash in the hope of a digital strategy. An old company trying to stay alive in “new times”. Not to mention COVID...

(3) Related to the long-term, even if they are successful in building an online marketplace, consumers won’t be buying games (software, which is  50% of revenues) IMO, from marketplaces or from physical locations. My view is that they will buy and download directly from the console as i) internet speeds increase ii) internet spends become cheaper and iii) or smart TVs link in a “gaming marketplace” where consumers buy/rent games... same goes for PC etc. Think what Netflix did to Blockbuster. Even Blockbuster tried to do a “Blockbuster Online” in August 2004... in September 2010 the company filed for Bankruptcy protection. Why is GameStop different? Why can they make the switch more effectively? Why do people continue to go to Brick and mortar stores vs. Purchase online? How can GameStop’s executive team truly turn around? Why do executives leave this company due to “personal reasons” (previous. CEO/CFO)...my guess is they saw the writing on the wall.

(4) Valuation: so what are you really paying for? 8x 20A EBITDA and +60x 20A PE... -50% FCF yield... in a company that is experiencing extreme structural headwinds and competition. Are you sufficiently compensated for the risk you are taking on in their “digital strategy” execution? I think not, but that is your decision. I guess they have $500M in cash to fund the dream for a bit, but odds are a dilutive equity financing comes or something worse. Your better of IMO buying a met coal producer at 4X EBITDA or an “actual” tech company at 15x sales. What do you really want to pay for a shitty Brick and Mortar business with low margins that has dreams to have a website... when the dust settles you can only cut so many costs and this company will be fighting for life over the next few years (if it survives)

My bet is the company goes bankrupt before it executes the strategy and/or your money is in limbo for the near term.",t1_gi1ci84,4

Long term (2+ years): bearish for all your reasons and more. We still have no idea how the PC thing is going to work, or why Microsoft felt obligated to fork over a percentage of all digital purchases to GME, so there is hope for the future, but it won't be enough to change bearish sentiment until we have more details (hopefully at ICR).

Short term: highly dependent on a Cohen takeover. The current board's mindset is ""How do we delay our inevitable death?"" Cohen's mindset is ""How do we avoid death altogether?""

Very short term: all signs irrefutably point to a squeeze. A Cohen takeover and/or great news about the company's shifting direction will make the squeeze push even higher with bullish hype, but the squeeze is happening even if we get bearish news. *Edit*: This is thanks to all the shorts betting on immediate bankruptcy, which means even a 1-year death will kill the shorts.",t1_gi1j2tr,3

- Some bulls buy calls with too short of expiration dates and are overconfident. Just wanting to be in a  confirmation bias loop.
