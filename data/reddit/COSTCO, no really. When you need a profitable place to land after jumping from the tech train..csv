Time = compounding returns. 

This is the secret, the only secret to the market. Time. Multiply that 10% to 3,000$ over 10 years on a piece of paper. Now 45 years that represents your time in the workforce before retirement. 

Add religiously, reinvest dividends, play the long game...but set aside a portion for fun WSB. I‚Äôll be honest I have 5k in small cap unknowns and SPACS as my yolo that shit to the moon. But I also did DD, ran the numbers, and said fuck it they have a SWEET name (cough cough Kraken Robotics) and every space SPAC I can. But that‚Äôs not my core, that‚Äôs my play money after 3 years of playing it very smart and conservative. 

Most of the crowd that‚Äôs been around here pre GME use their fun money for WSB style fuckery. Build a value based core to your portfolio then fuck around and yolo some shit.",t1_gpiw5zj,6

1614755848.0,2020-11-22,wallstreetbets,gpielse,"No, the guy getting $16 isn't getting $17 - they're not giving a bump to people who are already at or above the new minimum.  (As an aside, this is one of the big criticisms of minimum wage hikes in general - they benefit only people who were below the new minimum wage; and the theory goes that they raise prices, hurting workers who are at or above the new minimum due to lowered buying power and no wage increase)  
  
The billions they spent on the sanitation crap, well that's already a sunk cost regardless of whether the pandemic is ending or not.  When was this expenditure?  If it was after the last earnings report, I'd believe it having an effect on SP.  But if it was earlier than that, it's already been priced in.  
As far as food going up, I see that as a likelihood that more people will shop costco - it's likely to go up more at regular retail grocery stores.  I've not yet been to a costco that wasn't stupid busy at any normal or prime traffic hours.  They're definitely not hurting for business.  If the wage hike has any effect on financials, it's going to be barely a blip.",t1_gpie01f,2

It works out for me in the short term, with my daughter and 2 grandkids living with me, but once they're back out on their own, it won't.

Even still, that raises the wage cost of this to 374.4m/yr (at current employee count, roughly, and assuming all employees are full time 40 hr/wk).  That's, for a whole year of the wage increase, 1% of their latest quarterly revenue.  I still say it's barely a blip on the radar.",t1_gpiixop,2

Costco has pretty good deals because they restrict their GM to 15%. They also have sales on things quite regularly. 

If you really want to save and buy high quality, shop at Costco business center. Any costco member can go there. Lower prices, and the sales at costco regular apply there as well.

I don't mean options like execs get, but some companies have an employee stock purchase program that lets them buy stock at a certain amount cheaper than the market price - usually via a paycheck deduction, opt in of course.  Do they have anything like that for the regular workers there?  
I've always considered that to be a good sign, especially if workers are participating in it.  Companies whos employees are personally vested in its success beyond just keeping their wage and healthcare typically tend to do better.",t1_gpijata,2
