1630464372.0,2021-09-01,wallstreetbets,hb52s82,"Over the past 25 years, the median September has been green.

Of the past 4 Septembers, only 2020 has been red, and that was on the edge of a pandemic spike people were expecting and a contentious election period.

Septembers which follow turbulent Augusts where selloffs have occurred may be less likely to be red in part because the pressure in the market was released by those sell-offs (this was an August with several sell-offs).

Red September was a phenomenon primarily from before 1980, when brokers took significant vacation periods during the summer. Since then, vacation patterns have spread out, the rise of algorithmic trading has blunted the pattern, and now that we're in a fully remote environment, the pattern may completely fade away.

We're also in a weird period where we're partially in pandemic recovery and market destabilization and volatility came during summer, which is normally stable.. so old patterns may not hold.

There's nothing special about September. I'm not saying we won't have a red month, just pointing out that the idea that it's inevitable that we will is horse manure.",t3_pfdkjw,31
