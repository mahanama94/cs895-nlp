I think about it all the time and it really fucks with me, I feel like there is some timer out there that I have to beat or else my fate will be the same as my coworkers. I see all these people in the office who have given 30 years to one company, while every day complaining and hating their life. Who save up vacation time and never use a day, just to make their slimy bosses happy. Thats no way to live bros. This is our time, and we can make our fantasy a reality.

In all reality, he was probably some 17 year old kid who got high off his own farts and loved to shove his fingers up his butthole while watching his life savings go up when he rode DKNG from 20 to 40. Then he called everyone retarded for two months saying he was a stock market prodigy, and then completely disappeared after it fell from 45 to 30 because he was probably balls deep in nothing but calls.

He literally called all of us retarded and said he was never wrong, saying it would go to 60, then 100..he must be quite sad, arrogance truly is blinding when everyone thinks they're Michael Burry🥺🥺🥺
