I hope all of you gamble yourself into a position where you can retire next week. Perhaps spend the rest if your time on this earth focusing your efforts on butterfly conservation research, and fucking hot redheads. At least, that's what I would do.

But we both know you won't. You'll just end up back at your parents house again. Eating off brand chicken nuggies and pissing into empty 2 liters of Mountain Mist.

Then again... maybe you will hit it big. And you'll finally be able to save the Glasswings in Mexico, and drink watered down Margs at a swim up bar. You have the potential... you're only 1 trade away.

Anyways, they continued talking about stocks except instead of tickers they kept saying fund names. This made me angry so I said, ""fucking options or mysuck dick."" Which I guess sounded like I was offering a blow job, but I was just getting excited and said that instead of suck my dick.
So after I said that a few of them made a few good natured jokes and pointed at whoever was behind me. A few jokes later they all sort of realized I was more experienced and we're probably worried I'd steal their wives if they saw my dick or tendies so they went to a different part of the bar to continue their conversation.
