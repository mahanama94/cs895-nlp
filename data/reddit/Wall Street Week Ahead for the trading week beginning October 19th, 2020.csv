1602941937.0,2021-09-04,wallstreetbets,g93oacf,"Please note, the differences in the stimulus packages proposed by the White House and Pelosi does not amount solely to $400B, but to a number of wonky details like $400 vs $600 for unemployment, liability protections, and more. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill (@Drew_Hammill) is the best account to follow for updates on talks between Mnuchin and Pelosi.",t3_jcumcj,7

1602968234.0,2021-09-04,wallstreetbets,g952ju6,"What pisses me off is that you never know what these big boys are gonna do with the news. Yeah, the Fall Covid spike is here now and numbers are officially rising. But so far, it's all falling in line with what the models and experts predicted. They've been screaming about Fall/Winter being bad for months now. From what I can see, the cases/deaths so far haven't been radically different from predictions.

Obviously they know this and they've also known that the stimulus has been at an impasse for quite a while now. So is this shit priced in or are we gonna see a huge sell-off where they feign surprise at this news to justify it?",t3_jcumcj,3
