1608671339.0,2020-12-23,wallstreetbets,ggqaanv,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Congress finally passed the stimulus bill and the Internet proceed to meme the $600 stimulus check becauase let's face it, its a fairly peasant amount given context of situation. Package includes bailout for airlines, new round of PPP ""loans"" and more. Market reacts muted to the passing of the pRiCe iN bill tho QQQ traded green for most of the day (after a quick trip to red town before noon), thanks mostly to AAPL. What would we do without Tim Apple honestly?
* WSB GME gang has collectively nutted today, at least, for those who have diamond handed and/or load-up even more long position after the ER dump. The fabled GME squeeze may be happening in earnest as shares of the gaming retailer shot up as high as 26% during intraday high to $20 without any real additional news beyond Cohen adding to his position (revealed in a filing yesterday). As long as your entry and expiry wasn't beyond retarded, you should be making decent money on GME today. Popular expiry includes calls after April given that'll bake in the much touted Q4 ER period where new console cycle sale numbers will be revealed. WSB eagerly awaits for GME call bro to post his next update. Back of envelop math should have our bro back up about 800k at the very least. GME close the day up 25% to $19.46.
* AAPL continues its rally from yesterday's closing hours and into AH as the stock is now also an EV play. Tim Apple is up 2.85% for the day (though intraday high was higher at almost 4%) and WSB eagerly awaits it to cross the 3 trillion market cap mark. Ez.
* In a sign of ample liquidity in the market, IAC, the boomer ""tech/internet"" stock you probably haven't heard of announced that they will be spinning off their full Vimeo stake, which will IPO in Q2 of 2021. Shares of IAC is up 14.10% for the day and closed at $183.73.
* Can't cuck the Zuck? Facebook offered state and federal investigators a quick rub in the form of creating a new social network in return for dropping those lame antitrust shenanigan. Somehow the govt declined the offer. Those fools. They could have brought back Friendster and MySpace but boomers are still stuck with Facebook and its flat earth and fan pages. Shares of FB continues to be pressured due to antitrust investigation and fell a bit further than general macro movements, with FB at -2% for the day, closing at $267.
* In more big corp vs big brother action, the Feds are now after Walmart (again?), with the justice department suing WMT for fueling the opioid crisis cuz they didn't babysit people with iffy prescriptions (despite WMT internal pharmacists flagging these issues). Shares cratered -2% to low $143 but has since slowly recovered as this probably won't have any real material impact on WMT in the long term and will merely be settled with some sorta peasant amount in fines. WMT closed the day down -1.21% to $144.20
* Sell the news appears to be in full swing for vaccine stocks as MRNA, BNTX, NVAX and others are getting pummeled through the day. MRNA was down about 9.66% to just under $125, BNTX was down -7.58% to $98, and NVAX was down -10.43% to $111 during intraday low points.
* PTON scores a flurry of upgrades and price target increases as the fitness company returns into movement land, announcing that they will purchase fitness provider Precor for $420m. This gives Peloton much needed manufacturing capacity increase and the deal was met with positive reaction from the market. During intraday high, PTON was up as much as 13%+ to $165. Shares closed up 11.65% to $161. Notable PT upgrades: Wedbush $130 to $160, Stifel $144 to $160, KeyBanc $160 to $185, and Goldman Balls from $144 to $162. No doubt Citron is gonna post something about its valuation again in the near future.
* In other WSB meme stock land, MT continues to trade flat even with an initial morning pop, despite the AM price target increase from KeyBanc, who upped the PT to $28 from $23 while keeping his overweight rating. For PLTR, the stock tested the new $29 channel and proceed to fade through out the day, with intraday low as much as -3.5% to just shy of $27. Shares closed the day down -1.65% at $28. For TSLA, share price continues its retreat on its 2nd day of SPX inclusion, with shares down about -1.46% to end the day at $640.
* It's a short trading week as the market will close early Thursday so plan your FDs accordingly. Notable #s releasing tomorrow: durable goods and jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET, new home sales at 10 AM ET, and EIA draw report at 10:30 AM ET. No interesting ER this week tho Paychex does report BMO on Wednesday morning.

any short positions greater than 10,000 shares will have to be covered soon

EDIT: WHAT IT MEANS


‚Äú Subject to the requirements of SEC Rule 203 of Regulation SHO 		Where there is an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency totaling 10,000 shares or more and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer‚Äôs total shares outstanding.  When this occurs, the security becomes subject to mandatory close-out requirements outlined in the SEC's Regulation SHO.
The allowed values are:           Y = Yes, if the issue is subject to mandatory close-out requirements of Regulation SHO		N = No, if the issue is NOT subject to mandatory close-out requirements of Regulation SHO ‚Äú

https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm    Lots of reading but the following is interesting given the above # of days GME has actively been on the threshold securities list:  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Rule 204 ‚Äì Close-out Requirement‚Ä¶‚Äù   ‚Äú‚Ä¶In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as ‚Äúthreshold securities,‚Äù if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days‚Ä¶‚Äù
