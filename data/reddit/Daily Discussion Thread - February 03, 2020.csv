do less judging. my mom and i both love our lives.

edit: this comment was probably a little ruder than it should‚Äôve been, so i apologize for the comment. understand you‚Äôre just trying to help
folks. fortunately my whole family is doing well financially, and more importantly we‚Äôre all happy and healthy. my mom is the most selfless person i‚Äôve ever met, so while it sounds BS, she truly didn‚Äôt want anything in return - she just wanted to help since i was moving cities for a promotion and had a lot of expenses along with the recurring ones. sincerely appreciate you wanting to help though, i know your heart is in the right place ü§ôüèª",t1_fgfse5z,6
