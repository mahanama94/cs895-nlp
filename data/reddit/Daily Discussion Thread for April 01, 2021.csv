There's basically no BID orders(buyers trying to buy low) compared to the 90 quintillion ASK orders (sellers trying to sell high) from people expecting to be able to sell up to $730

means most of the people looking to buy will probably buy asking price because they don't think the price will drop low enough to trigger their Limit Buys

and most of the people looking to Sell expect the price to go up enough to hit their Limit Sell
