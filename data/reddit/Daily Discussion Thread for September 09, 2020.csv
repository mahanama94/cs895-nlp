1599650229.0,2020-09-09,wallstreetbets,g4jb6an,"In Jan 1982, The Vancouver Stock Exchange launched their own index (VSE), an average of the \~1500 companies being traded. It was set to an initial value of 1000. 

However, even though North America was amidst a great bull market and the market seemed to be doing well, the index mysteriously kept dropping, and closed at 524.811 in November 1983. 

Every time a stock value changed, which happened \~3000 times a day, the index value was recalculated and updated. This calculation produced a value with 4 decimal points, but the reported version of the index used only 3. 

Instead of rounding (like SPY does), VSE just dropped the 4th digit. The index kept dropping because truncation meant the value was always rounded down, whereas rounding would have made sure it was rounded up as often as down.

Over the weekend of  November 25-28, the correct value of the index was calculated and the index jumped overnight from the incorrect 524.811 to the recalculated 1098.892, the highest % gain in the history of any index. 

Imagine buying calls before that weekend.

1599654880.0,2020-09-09,wallstreetbets,g4jgs96,"Everyone's getting excited about futures - however a simple math reminder is in order.  The hill for many of you is a longer climb then you expect.  If your options that you bought lost 20% of it's value, it doesn't gain back it's value by rising 20% - it does by rising 25%

The mathematical relationship between losses and gains is a reciprocal one. 

Needed % gain to restore loss:

`[1 / (1 - % Loss)] - 1`

Example - to claw back from a 10% loss:

`[1 / (1 - .10)] - 1 = .1111 or 11.11%`

In 1990s, dog racing betting software in some Las Vegas casinos could be gamed so you could place bets after the race had finished.

The software was adapted from horse racing software and kept track of when to stop taking new bets (horses/dogs entering gates), start, and results posted, in hours and minutes, since horse races always take more than a minute. 

However, dog races can be over in seconds, and it's possible to go from ""close all bets"" to ""results posted"" in less than a minute. Let's say all bets closed at 09:42:03 and results were posted at 09:42:51. Since the software only kept track of hours and minutes, both these time would show up as 09:42. Hence, you could place bets on the winning dog at 09:42:55 and make literally free money.

ATHX set to break out definitively in the next 4-6 months. Their Japanese partner, Healios, is on track to complete P3 studies for both ARDS and Ischemic Stroke by the end of Q4. Data from previous trials looks like a grand slam for both compared with current standard of care.

Japanese government is VERY favorable toward regenerative medicine and there is a clear path to conditional approval in Q1 2021. [They treated the last patient of a 5 patient cohort of Covid-specific ARDS on Aug 12.](https://twitter.com/athersys/status/1293567745368436737) Their first primary readout data is set for 28 days post-treatment, which is September 10.
It could be a few weeks for this data to get analyzed and released, but it seems clear that BIG things are coming before Q2 next year. I'm not sure it can be overstated how much of an impact this product can have on the world...stroke absolutely ruins lives and comes with a lifelong disability sentence. Do a little more DD on this company and their product (MultiStem) if you're curious. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of medical indications that it will revolutionize (GvHD, trauma, improving quality of donated organs)

I have worked on this product at my previous job and I am 100% sold on it. Looking at shares alone to be a 50 bagger over the next 3-5 years when its potential is fully realized. Japanese approval in 2021, USA approval on track for late 2021/early 2022, DoD funded clinical trial on Trauma to be completed 2022. So many catalysts both short and long term. Options are harder because of timing uncertainty, but any Jan calls should print and DEFINITELY any April. Will continue to buy more every chance I get, especially since this stock has been so savagely beaten down recently. Been investing in them since Mar 2019, avg cost $1.38/share until I FOMO'd in hard during their April pump this year. An expensive and painful lesson to a green investor, but the underlying thesis is unchanged and why I continue to buy more. Cheers and let's get rich, you retards.
