They were really smart in the beginning, shifting to streaming before anyone else. But lately, they seem legit retarded.

They make and license *so much fucking trash,* it's ridiculous. So fucking many netflix originals, and 99% of them are absolute garbage. You can scroll for like 10 hours and find a show or movie that netflix produces that like 5 people on earth have probably watched, lol. They suck at producing content, and they suck even harder at marketing it. Every damn day I log on and see 15 new things that I've never fucking heard of in my life. It's like an indian flea market of streaming content.

All this content, and yet they have like 2-4 shows/movies that get some buzz every year.

They're getting desperate and choosing quantity over quality, then this forces them to raise subscription prices.

Look at HBO as a counter-example. They are making like 5-10 shows at a time, make a handful of movies a year, and license new releases. And people happily pay because damn near everything you'll find there is top-notch quality.

Meanwhile Netflix just has 10,000 shows that all suck ass.",t3_jk7d6g,17

>With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits.
