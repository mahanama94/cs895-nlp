The setup was heavily telegraphed last week when the vix spiked up 30% on Thursday. When you get spikes like that without much market movement (talking like under 3% swings) it's a heavy option flow increase. The setup was further confirmed when we had the MASSIVE equity dump EOD Friday, you can check the charts we're talking 6 million apple shares, Amazon, etc. And a MASSIVE share buy influx into the inverse ETF's and vix trackers IE SQQQ UVXY etc. The same exact thing happened before our last correction in October, you can look it up and see the exact same pattern before everything went to shit.

March is going to be red unless we get a crazy amount of QE from the fed which is a 50/50 chance but they could let this play out to keep eyes off inflation fears.
