The 2007 stock market top and the 2009 market bottom were both identified by a divergence between the S&P 500 [**SPX,** **0.22%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) index and the VIX. Since then we had several bearish non-confirmations that warned of significant corrections. 

The 10-day correlation between the S&P 500 index and the VIX has risen into positive territory, which serves as an effective short-term sell signal.

Right now, this VIX warning signal is flashing again as it did earlier this year and prior to the corrections in the first and fourth quarter of 2018.

In short, the options market is sending a message that volatility going forward is likely to be greater than the stock market currently implies.",t3_ihieiu,9
