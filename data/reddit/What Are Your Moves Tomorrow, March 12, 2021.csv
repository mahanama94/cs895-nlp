1615497302.0,2021-03-12,wallstreetbets,gqm9fxz,"**You know what the WSB Rites of Passage are? I think I've been able to chalk up pretty much every tier:**

**Bronze Level**

- Asking what basic things are instead of Googling them yourself, e.g. ""If I buy a call, does that mean it goes up?""

- Winning your first trade, suddenly getting euphoric that you're the next Michael Burry and bragging to all your friends

- ""Where do I check stock futures?""

**Silver Level**

- Making anywhere from 10 to 25% on your portfolio, all of your family members suddenly think you're a genius, and you excitedly tell all your friends about the ""strategies"" you learned

- Playing at least one meme stock at least once from Daily Threads, and winning on it out of pure luck but telling people you ""Did your DD"" meaning you got your DD from a guy in WSB comments

- Shove fingers up your asshole & sniff your own farts from being so euphoric about your geniusness after trading for 1 to 3 months

- Browse WSB on the daily, trading has become your new hobby, and Dad tells you ""Hey, you're pretty good..you could make a career out of this!""

- Friends tell you you're gambling, you tell them ""It's MORE than just gambling, it's--"" as you go on a pseduo-understanding rant of the markets who learned all his terminology from WSB

**Gold Level**

- Losing anywhere up to 99% of your portfolio, usually getting wiped out by a SINGLE red day after 2 months or more of straight green days

- Made tons of money on ridiculously OTM calls, *""B-But stocks only go up!""* --> it only works until it doesn't, everyone is a genius in a bull market, all gains lost in one day of red

- Getting burned on Boeing, AAL, UAL, or any travel stock at least once

- Depression gang hits hard, always bargaining ""I KNEW I should have sold"" or ""WHY DIDN'T I BUY THIS INSTEAD""

- Use of WSB starts to decline as you dip down into a state of depression and acceptance that you've reached Stage 3, and you were a degenerate gambler all along

- ""Why is my brokerage calling me?""",t3_m30mij,294
