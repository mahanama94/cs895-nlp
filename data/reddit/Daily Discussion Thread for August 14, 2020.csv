Big tech went through the roof because it'll perform well when everyone is forced to stay at home. We opened the economy, everyone went outside, and tech... set new all-time highs.

Moderna published the same vaccine press release multiple times and the market pumped each time, never giving up the gains.

Grubhub went through the roof on rumors it was being bought out by Uber. Deal fell through, GH never gave up those gains and is even higher now.

AMC Theaters pumped on rumors Amazon was looking to buy it. Came out the next day that it was the AMC tv channel, not the theater chain. The stock gave up only half of its gains from the rumor. Free 10% on a nothingburger.

Hertz hit 0.56 when it announced bankruptcy filings, bounced to ~0.80 and stayed there a while. Following the most autistic pump in market history it's leveled out at motherfucking 3X the low and been there for two months. You'd have made 200% if you bought the low and diamond handed your way through the entire pump and dump.",t3_i9jdiq,20

It is ridiculous to claim that the U.S. economy needs more fiscal stimulus when we currently have the largest dose of fiscal and monetary stimulus in U.S. history. If government stimulus really worked the U.S. economy would already be booming. The stimulus is actually a sedative.
