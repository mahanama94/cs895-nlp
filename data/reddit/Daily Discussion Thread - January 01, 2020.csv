Hopefully enough of you were paying attention, to notice that in late 2018 ((November, December)) the US stock market tanked, and dragged everything down with it.  I think Dow fell to All-Time-Lows like 23,000.  Thanks in no small part to the Bad Orange Man tweeting ""More tariffs on China today!"" whenever he felt like it.


Then in 2019, when all that nonsense stopped and all of his lawyers were ending up in jail, the markets finally recovered, making it look like the year had 15 percent gains. 

BUT THOSE GAINS are just what was lost last Christmas!!

Don't buy options that expire in a few days unless you except it's gambling not investing.  Risk goes up tremendously when you hold overnight, 10 fold risk holding over a weekend.  Options has been part of my trading for 7 years, 90% of the time I'm in and out within hours at most, 10-15k is the most I'll buy in lots at one time, but I do double down when I'm confident in direction.
Buying anything right at open or close comes with more risk and reward.  Decent, repeated modest 4-10% gains can be had buying in during lunchtime dip and selling shortly thereafter, but nothing is guarantee.  Follow a stock for awhile don't just dive in, some I've followed for years but only play maybe 8-10 weeks out of the year but with a high success rate.  Get to know at least the price's past few weeks of floor and ceiling and what influences it.  I like to find stocks that have been beaten up over earnings and have recent insider buys.  What the insider paid is a good indicator of current floor price.  Don't feel it necessary to claim tribalism to being in the bull or bear gang.  This past year I was more calls than puts for obvious reasons but i was still about 70/30 calls/puts.  Once you win more than lose with directional option plays you can branch out.  I stick with 40k account for my options tradings and sometimes that's all on margin depending on my portfolio holdings, whatever I gain after accounting for taxes goes into long holds.",t1_fcr78ia,4

1577900165.0,2020-01-01,wallstreetbets,fcrczia,"It's a bunch of compounding issues.  The underlying issue is Degenerative Disc Disease, but given the scar-like tissue they found I probably had a herniated/ruptured disk at some point.  Coupled with costochondritis (basically arthritis in my sternum/ribs) and scapulothoracic bursitis (my shoulder blade rubs against my ribs) it's just all one big mess of inflammation.

I've hurt my back a lot since I was younger, and I think I fractured my collarbone once and never saw PT for any of it, so it's mostly my own careless doing over time",t1_fcrca9r,2

PT was somewhat ineffective for me, and would lead to ‚Äútweaks‚Äù which created numbness up and down my leg. Not too much pain

Sitting around however was far worse and led to pain, so I just sucked up the tweaks, stayed active
