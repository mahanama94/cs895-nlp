The line would get so long that it would circle the inside of the store and then continue out towards the parking lot, and into the street. 

People were idiots tho, because back in those days we didn't have portable dvd players and the razor cell phone was the shit..... so when the power went out for days or weeks, you weren't going to be able to watch your rented movies.....
