I actually had this happen some years ago. Literally all he said was ""wow"" then a slight chuckle upon opening my account.

My butthurt ass filed a complaint to corporate. tl;dr ""HOW DARE THEY SHAME MY GAMBLING ADDICTION I HAVE A JOB"" 

They made that rep leave me 2 phone messages and a letter apologizing.

I think I was handing that broker thousands of dollars in contract fees per year.
