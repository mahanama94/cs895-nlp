1630552753.0,2021-03-13,wallstreetbets,hb9sv4e,"Ive done some research on this sector recently and 100% agree.

Uranium is such a good Risk-Reward play here for many reasons. The top being probably the insane Supply&Demand imbalance and the fact that its pretty uncorrelated to GDP. Despite bigger indexes rolling over this could be the least impacted sector.  


In the previous cycle 2000-2007 the whole sector grew by 50x and some individual equties by 1000x",t3_pg2pdy,109

1630586166.0,2021-03-13,wallstreetbets,hbb48w9,The beautiful thing about the uranium futures market is for every seller there is a corresponding physician buyer it’s not like the gold and silver futures where the bullion banks sell 500 contracts but only 1 buyer is looking for a physical delivery. That’s a casino in PM’s futures market and the bullion banks own the casino. So when Sprott Physical uranium trust buys U308 in the futures market it is creating an actual squeeze on price of spot uranium. Bullion banks don’t fuck around with uranium futures market simply because there is no volume to make money on it due to low liquidity. It’s a perfect storm right now in Uranium sector,t3_pg2pdy,32

Other U-heads on twitter are wondering if utilities should just buy SPUT themselves as a hedge against rising U spot. Obviously, the first utilities to buy in would reap the largest offset to spot prices. The next big boost in U prices could be utilities hedging. Keep 'em scared!

2. I’ll quickly put this here now as it’s the only thing you retards will consider as valid info: CEO was at the helms of another U company during the last bull run and it when x1000 %. Yes that’s right +1000%

3. Mining/producing in the state of Wyoming, governor is pro nuclear energy

3. Have already secured long term contracts to supply

4. Was one step ahead and purchased their own physical uranium on the spot market before the bull run 

5. SP is cheap as fuck

6. These guys are not explorers/new to the game. They are legit the real deal

7. Ready to turn the key on production as soon as slot price hits x. We are almost at x now

Then I finally get a response from one of the mods saying that I was spreading hate. It was weird. What I am saying is be careful when you end up in a sub that has the word squeeze in it.

Uranium does make a lot of sense though.
