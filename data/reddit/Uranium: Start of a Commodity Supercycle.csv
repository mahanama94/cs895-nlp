Uranium is such a good Risk-Reward play here for many reasons. The top being probably the insane Supply&Demand imbalance and the fact that its pretty uncorrelated to GDP. Despite bigger indexes rolling over this could be the least impacted sector.  


In the previous cycle 2000-2007 the whole sector grew by 50x and some individual equties by 1000x",t3_pg2pdy,109

Other U-heads on twitter are wondering if utilities should just buy SPUT themselves as a hedge against rising U spot. Obviously, the first utilities to buy in would reap the largest offset to spot prices. The next big boost in U prices could be utilities hedging. Keep 'em scared!

1-2 months out and 10-15% above  (or wherever it gets cheap out of the money), and then pretty much as long dated as I possibly can and waaaay OTM. NXE that's mostly 12/22 for me, URA is 6/22 as the 1/23 were too pricey to my eyes.

NXE OTM only goes to $7 though, so that could be hit in like two weeks. ;)

I don't really understand why NXE 12/22 are so cheap at both $5 and $7. You can do a credit debt of buy $5 and sell $7 for a net cost of \~$.55 out of pocket and you have a long time to realize that 263% profit. Or just buy calls. I might be too cautious.",t1_hb8o82c,26
