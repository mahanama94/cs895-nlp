Instead, buy a 1/15/21 $15c and sell a 1/15/21 $35c. This costs $6.30. If you buy the $30c outright, your breakeven at expiration is $34.80/share. Anything under that, you lose money. If you play the spread, your breakeven is $21.30. If SPCE closes January 2021 at $40/share, if you bought the call outright, you'd make $620. If you play the spread, you'd make $1370.

1581539787.0,2020-02-12,wallstreetbets,fhfazvo,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

Wanted to post this intraday because lots of stuff on the crayons are changing, so people can start making up their minds on holdings for tomorrow.

[SPY is projecting to close](https://imgur.com/gaZZnZB) on the resistance [I mentioned yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2f0ag/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_12/fhcb3by/) at around 337. However, any autist can notice that we've broken above the green crayon (resistance trendline) twice now, and broken 337 already today. Normally this means we should start to head into a new price channel, and we might. I think it will hinge on price action tomorrow. 

If we jump up tomorrow, resistance is at 339.2. It would also put us back into the strong bullish trend we had before the Corona correction, which we've been trying to recover from since.

However, there are two things that might make the reward of hedging a few puts a decent idea. [/NQ futures is about to test the top of their resistance channel,](https://imgur.com/1Hl787s) which has not been broken since November of 2019. [VIX is also starting to break below its current trend](https://imgur.com/GE1WgNO), which means a reversal on all these fronts (resistance on SPY, NQ, support on VIX) would make a lot of ""crayon"" sense.

CPI is being released tomorrow, and for the past two years has been above this time's projected 0.2% increase in Feb (0.6% in 2017, 0.4% in 2018). You can argue whether inflation is ""bad"" or ""good,"" but it may be difficult to judge how the market will react if we have a much higher CPI than anticipated. 

So again, based on crayons and CPI tomorrow, I think trimming holdings some or hedging with a few puts is not a bad idea in terms of risk/reward. But crayons can't predict exactly what's going to happen, and like any voodoo shit, crayons can be read differently based on who you are (i.e. someone seeing the crack in VIX and SPY could read it as nothing but good times ahead). I just wanted to bring this to your attention so you can decide how best to keep your tendies.",t3_f2plur,17
