My AMA:

My favorite cannabis has a heavy dosage of THC-V. I’ve found this plant to work wonders on my ADHD.

Aaaaaand this is why TA gets clowned.

So $20 is support, except when it occasionally falls below it.

Also, $20 is support even though the stock has traded below $20 for all but like 3 days in the past month.

As far as I can tell, yesterday was the only time all month where the stock wasn’t trading below $20 at some point",t3_nwseag,16

1623704590.0,2021-07-04,wallstreetbets,h1rvtbv,"Questions for AMA:

1. Privateer has/had relationships with multiple U.S. companies/ brands that are unclear to investors. Does Privateer still own Docklight Brands? Multiple of the brands owned by Docklight such as *The Goodship, Marley Natural,* and *Irisa* were listed on the High Park website before the merger despite the linked websites and social media pages being inactive and outdated with the exception of Marley. Similarly, could you please describe Privateer's relationship with Left Coast Ventures and if there are any other things investors may not know (Does Tilray sell Marley Natural products in Canada though licensing agreements etc.)?
2. I know that Tilray's cannabis brands are being introduced to Sweetwater beers, but can Sweetwater products with THC be produced and sold in Canada? This would obviously make sense for both growing market share in drinks, and preparing to sell THC/CBD drinks in the U.S. . I'm gonna throw in another question to this category: Canopy is already selling their CBD drinks in the U.S. why is Sweetwater/Tilray not doing this(Manitoba Harvest also does not seem to be focusing on CBD despite having a few products, will this change?(P.S. on the Manitoba Harvest website it's quite difficult to even realize they sell CBD, why not just call it CBD on a separate tab instead of hEmP eXtrAct SupPlemEnts? Maybe I just have bad taste)?
3. Have you thought about expanding Sweetwater internationally (beyond Delta)? I have no idea if this make sense. How about expanding the 420 Fest in the U.S. or into Canada?
4. If Mexico legalizes Cannabis does Tilray intend to expand into that market? If so how, exports?
5. I have minimal knowledge on Europe, but common sense and anecdotal evidence tells me their health systems are much better than the U.S. Will this positively impact Medical Cannabis sales in any way such as patients consuming more, Tilray being able to sell for higher prices etc.? Canada may have similar traits to what I'm assuming about EU healthcare, are there any evident differences in consumer trends between medical and recreational users in Canada?
6. Company culture: 
   1. Irwin: I know many challenges have been created due to Covid, but a common theme amongst recent interviews has been saying things to lower expectations (again - Covid, I know) while also talking about how a 30% market share will be achieved, and how synergies will be implemented. Do you think you can do better  in terms of being straight up. 
   2. Employee reviews, Tilray has a 2.2 Indeed rating, and Aphria has a 2.7 indeed rating: There is a general theme across these reviews of a poor work culture, with many complaints about about poor management, and employees being treated poorly. Can you/are you/ will you do anything to improve the relationship between employees and management? 
7. This one is for Irwin, I'm just being nosy feel free to ignore: I recall from a past interview you said you met with Brendan Kennedy in Florida, and 'Had some other meetings there too' or something like that, I am just wondering if you can confirm that is true or if you said that, thanks!

Thanks for your time, I hope to see more of these in the future!!",t3_nwseag,3

Original Girl Scout cookies were bred using Durban poison which is an African landrace that also contains trace levels of THCV.

Doug’s varin is probably the most well known strain that’s been bred specifically for high levels of this compound. If you in Cali you should have no issue tracking Doug’s Varin down.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Letter to the Stockholders of Tilray, Inc.
Invitation to Special Meeting that will be Held Virtually on Thursday, July 29th, 2021
Dear Fellow Stockholders,
We need your help to ensure Tilray grows. Please take a few minutes to read this letter, the accompanying materials,
and then vote online.
Just last month, we ushered in a new era for the global cannabis industry by announcing the completion of our
combination with Aphria Inc. That transaction brought together two highly complementary businesses to create the
“new” Tilray with the largest geographic footprint and leading cannabis-focused portfolio of consumer-packaged
goods in the world.
The “New” Tilray is Off to a Running Start: As promised, our focus now turns to execution on our highest-return
priorities, including business integration, cost-synergy realization, and accelerating our global growth strategy. We
are poised to strike and transform the industry with our highly scalable operational footprint, a curated portfolio of
diverse medical and adult-use cannabis brands and products, a multi-continent distribution network, and a robust
capital structure to fund our global expansion strategy and deliver sustained profitability and long-term value for all
of our stakeholders.
We Have Substantial Growth Opportunities Ahead and We Need Your Support: To implement the next phase
of our strategy, we have a number of important matters to address at the upcoming Special Meeting of Stockholders
that will be critical to driving our business forward. You have the opportunity to vote on key proposals that we
believe will help us turn potential into performance and profitable growth.
1. Authorized Shares Proposal – Help Tilray Grow: This proposal would increase the number of
authorized shares of capital stock. The additional authorized shares would enable us to move quickly to
seize the highly attractive acquisition and financing opportunities we see ahead. By approving this
proposal, you will be enabling Tilray to accelerate growth and realize its potential. Please note that
approval does not mean that the authorized shares will be issued, only that they are available if needed so
the Company can move swiftly to seize value creation opportunities as they arise.
2. Governance Proposals - Expand Your Rights: Following the combination of Tilray and Aphria, our
Board undertook a comprehensive review of our corporate governance, taking into consideration the views
held by the investment community on important matters of governance. As a result, the Board is proposing
to expand the rights of our stockholders; but to do so, we need your approval on several amendments to
our corporate documents.
These proposals are critical to our growth strategy, so please vote today! You do not need to join us at the
Special Meeting to cast your vote. You can vote online in just a few minutes. Your support is extremely
important, no matter how many or how few shares you own.
