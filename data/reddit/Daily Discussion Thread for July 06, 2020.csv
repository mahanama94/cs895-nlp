Re


#____________________


Asian markets are rallying hard, and they have broken upper end of their range, major indexes have made new highs of the after crash rally


**India** up 1.47% 

**Hangseng** up 3.81% 

**Nikkei** up  1.83%


#_____________________



Europe indices are in a similar scenario like Asian market and have their dong errect and clearly visible, major resistance have been broken here too

**Dax** up 1.92% 


**CAC40** up 1.88%


**FTSE** up 1.87%


#_____________________


**Dow** futures (26,115.0) +356.0(+1.38%)

#____________________

Global markets are as bullish as it gets, Asia have made new rally highs and Europe breaking their major resistance has made each and every indices on a bull trend

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

Classic trend is your friend case thus we are avoiding to take any short position and are adding longs on dips, short chart suggests that we have transitioned from sell on rally to buy on dipa


Major support is still 305 and 307 and resistance is at 314 and 320, on long term charts, this excited me to core as 314 resistance have been broken in the future it self and that makes room for 320 test

I think we all will be surprised at the pace 320 will be seen


#Personal bias is that we will trade today between 310 - 320 with an expectation that 310 becomes a short term psychological support

If 314 manages to hold it can prove to become a support as strong as 300



#____________________


**Longterm** : it is very difficult to be bearish in long term view when NASDAQ itself is making new highs, we believe that Nasdaq 10k support has become as strong as spy 300 support, thus we are strongly bullish on long term, but we request you to add long term stocks in SIP mode to benefit the current volitality


Here is the usual alert 

(Alert : avoid Russel stocks cause the economic condition most likely will make big companies bigger and will wipe out small companies, the directional difference between Nasdaq, Dow, S and p and Russel is likely to continue )


#______________________

It's not only about resistance and support, but the type of reversal or breakout that has taken place in those levels, seeing the sharp reversal from 300 has made us believe that taking shorts is out of the menu in near and medium term, here the market gave clear indication to where we are going
