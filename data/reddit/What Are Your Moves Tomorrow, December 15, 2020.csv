1607980267.0,2020-12-15,wallstreetbets,gfuoaii,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* The electoral college is chugging along and almost done with voting President-Elect Biden into office, thereby cementing his win officially. While the contentious election will likely to continue well past inauguration, most Americans are likely to move on (unless you're a fucking snowflake). 
* The problem Solvers Caucus continues to try and push their bipartisan relief bill along in Congress but faces the same challenges they've been facing with the leaders in each respective party unwilling to budge on their main demands (liability/lower price tag from McTurtle; state/local funding from Pelosi). Funny enough, talks of direct payments of $1,200 to Americans aren't as urgent now that the election is behind us and the only ones threatening to stall current govt funding bill over it is Sanders and Josh Hawley (MO GOP Senator).
* Recent IPO ABNB and DASH both received downgrades earlier this morning, with Gordon Haskett moving Airbnb from Buy to Underperform with a $103 PT, a 26% downside. Shares were down almost 9% intraday morning to $127 as it closed the down -6.64%. Meanwhile, DASH was downgraded from Buy to Neutral at DA Davidson but with a higher price target of $150, up from $93. Shares of DASH closed -8.57%. Both analysts cites valuation as main catalyst for the downgrade. No doubt some WSBer is still bagholding from IPO highs. Don't worry fam, your baghold will earn some nice upvotes when you post the screenshots.
* AZN drilled almost 7% intraday today with news of its $39 billion dollar deal for Alexion. SPCE shares fell 15% pre-market (and recovered to about -12% intraday) after its Dec 12 test flight failed to reach space due to rocket motor failure. GUH to all SPCE weeklies holder, esp that ""pleas fly again"" bro. Dump your OTM FDs bro, they're dead.
* As rona continues to roam the country unabated, half-assed will we, wont we shut down measures are considered while aforementioned govt financial support continues in limbo in Congress. De Blasio has warned that NYC should prepare for full shutdown.
* AAPL launched their Apple Fitness+ today, stock closed down -0.51% while PTON was up 4.1%. GOOGL suffered widespread outages this morning on Gmail, YouTube, and Google Dive, stock was flat for the day but ended at -1.27%. AMZN subsidiary Zoox reveal their autonomous robotaxi today while CA's AG is asking for the courts to order AMZN to comply with subpoenas for more information on their covid safety measures. 
* After fading for more than 30% in the past few days, CD Projekt Red is offering refund for PS4 and Xbox One buyers as the bug ridden game continues to receive backlash. OTGLY opened at more than 17% down but has ""recovered"" to about -9.31% as the day closed.
* SPX went red for the day after initially opening green from vaccine rollout and touching intraday high of 0.9% up. The Dow also fell today thanks the pull back from components such as CVX and profit taking on DIS and general fear of renew lockdown measures. Chadsdaq manages to keep it green day thanks to a green day from select big tech AMZN, NFLX, et al., despite Tim Apple's red adventure (which partly contributed to SPX's fade to red as well). DJI closed down -0.62%, SPX -0.44%, and IXIC +0.50%.
* Noteworthy marketing moving numbers and events tomorrow: Empire State Manufacturing Index / Import & Export Prices at 8:30 AM ET and Fed's Industrial Production monthly index at 9:15 AM. On Wednesday, FOMC announcement at 2PM ET and Jpow speaks soon after at 2:30 PM ET. Just stfu and continue to brr, bro.",t3_kd6fsb,176

He suggested a single company should offer every step of the process. His professor gave him an F and said it was unfeasible. In 1971 Frederick founded Federal Express. 

Even though he came from money and had an eight million dollar loan from family, after paying for all the planes, offices, trucks, etc, they had run through all their capital and were running low on cash.

On a Friday in 1973, the company had $5,000 left in the bank. On monday they would have to pay employees and fuel the planes, and $5,000 wouldnt cover it. Fred decides to drive to Vegas with the companies last $5,000 to play blackjack. On monday morning, he wires $32,000 back to Fedex which was enough to get everyone paid and keep the lights on.

When people asked Fred why he was so reckless, he said at that point it was all or nothing, either he’d lose the company with 5k or save it by taking a chance. The man went on to lobby away some insane postal rules (back in the 70’s it was the law that only the postal service could deliver a letter, Smiths lobbying helped overturn this). Now his companies worth $144 billion. 

Still though shipping companies eat shit on the first quarter of the year so dont forget to load up on fedex/ups poots soon.",t3_kd6fsb,21

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.",t3_kd6fsb,31

At the end of February 2020 she purchased:

 150 MSFT $130 strike calls expiration 3/19/21 at a price of **60.20**

100 MSFT $140 strike calls expiration 3/19/21 at a price of **51.55**

Pelosi paid around **$1.4** million for these options and they are worth today around:

#$2,100,000

The funny thing is that she purchased this right before the COVID dip and held it through the pandemic. This is why we call her Diamond Hands Pelosi around here. 

So what is her latest options move? Heavy bet on PayPal this summer, she got a lot of shares and Purchased 50 call options with a strike of $100 and an expiration date of 01/21/2022
