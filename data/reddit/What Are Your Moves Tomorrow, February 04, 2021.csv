First time trader here from the UK. I jumped on the GME train. Hasn‚Äôt been going that well so far. I‚Äôm down 75% pretty much and still falling.
I say to myself, this is an experience, something to learn from. No matter how much I lose I will look back at this with joy that I‚Äôm part of it.
Already lost 75% what‚Äôs another 25%? Isn‚Äôt even worth selling whatever little is left right now.
So I‚Äôm holding to the end, I used spare income with the hope it‚Äôll rocket üöÄ but also full well knowing that if I lose it, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal.
So I say this to the other retards out there. Just hold, who knows what‚Äôs going to happen? Most of us noobs have already lost a big chunk and what‚Äôs a little more?
Rather stay in this for the long run and see what happens.

1612386698.0,2021-02-04,wallstreetbets,glwr82b,"To people worried about losing money:

1) Yeah, it sucks. No one knows the future, but we are all here for a cause (I am sure we can agree that this is more than a stock price now).

2) Hopefully this wasnt money you were counting on for survival. I mean we're called retards and the subreddit is called wallstreetBETS. This is, in the end, a waiting game. Try to remember that your checking the stock price isnt going to help. Set aside times you come and check these threads, but ultimately, just fucking wait. 

3) This wasnt ever going to be easy. On one hand there is wsb, on the other, lidrilly the US gov, SEC, hedge funds, etc - its uphill the ENTIRE fucking way. 

4) Sunk cost fallacy is a real thing. I am not wise enough to identify it, but i am guessing this one will plague a lot of us right now. Everyone's case is different. There is probably no good advice that is good for everyone. In my case, I'm down ~$5,000 which was otherwise invested in BE. I regret it EVERYDAY, but am holding,  not for profit, but because I fucking hate how shit been running this entire time. Fuck the millionaires for making money off the middle class, and if this tryst with upending the market doesnt work, there will be other opportunities. 

TLDR: Dont sell in a panic.

We've been taken hostage by the top mods. They left for years and came back when they smelled money. They've been busy creating private email addresses to funnel all the press correspondence away for their own gain, talking shit about all of the active mods, and scrambling to get paid from some movie deal. That's just what we know of. They refer to themselves as ""the board of directors"" and us as the minimods.

Reddit's system for subreddit ownership is broke and we begged for help.

The other plan is that some friend of the top mod's has wormed into his brain and is going to use WSB as a springboard to launch some stupid c.ry.to shit. We're supposed to be impressed and bend over because he says the name winklevoss. We can't stop it. No matter how hard we try to keep the ship stable and moving in the direction it's been moving for years... we continue to be saddled with this team of losers that wants nothing more than to return to cash in on something they didn't even have a hand in making.

One of them fucking asked ""what's fuckboy"" yesterday. You should see some of the screenshots I have.

You deserve to know that this place is being sold out on multiple levels by the people at the top, and that everyone below them wants them gone and is heartbroken.

They'll probably take this down and remove me and hire some asshole to replace me. Fuck it. Hi CNN. Fucking hilarious some assholes trying to call us OWS when we're literally being occupied.

He should have been the head mod in the first place but previous Subreddit Drama in early 2020 left a close personal friend of the original founder, who was removed by the admins for attempting to monetize the subreddit by selling investment classes run by noted losers of money, as the head mod. The actual head mod is generally inactive and has only recently returned to, apparently, personally profit off the recent growth and notoriety of the subreddit.

We've  been taken hostage by the top mods. They left for years and came back  when they smelled money. They've been busy creating private email  addresses to funnel all the press correspondence away for their own  gain, talking shit about all of the active mods, and scrambling to get  paid from some movie deal. That's just what we know of. They refer to  themselves as ""the board of directors"" and us as the minimods.

Reddit's system for subreddit ownership is broke and we begged for help.

The  other plan is that some friend of the top mod's has wormed into his  brain and is going to use WSB as a springboard to launch some stupid c.ry.to shit. We're supposed to be impressed and bend over because he  says the name winklevoss. We can't stop it. No matter how hard we try to  keep the ship stable and moving in the direction it's been moving for  years... we continue to be saddled with this team of losers that wants  nothing more than to return to cash in on something they didn't even  have a hand in making.

One of them fucking asked ""what's fuckboy"" yesterday. You should see some of the screenshots I have.

You  deserve to know that this place is being sold out on multiple levels by  the people at the top, and that everyone below them wants them gone and  is heartbroken.

They'll probably  take this down and remove me and hire some asshole to replace me. Fuck  it. Hi CNN. Fucking hilarious some assholes trying to call us OWS when  we're literally being occupied.

No politics. You'd know that if you wrote the damn rules.",t3_lby4jj,49
