Asset prices remain elevated and even edging higher because the Fed is running the entire operation, maintaining all bids. This is a process, not an event. Dimon and the lesser banks are now armed with vaults full of liquid cash ready to ride the downfall and buy up the dip when the signal is given to restart the next asset expansion program.
