""Stonks only go up"" is faltering because we're waiting for budget decisions involving the money printers. Every day the market will wander around based on people's opinions on what decision will be made with the money printers, and if you have your own set opinion on what that decision will be, you can just keep betting on movement in that direction and the market will stop wandering around and go that direction for real when the decision is made and you'll make bank.

The daily SPY chart can help you optimize your buy in prices but you only need to really care what it's doing if you are making short-term bets swing trading on these fluctuations in opinion and hoping to successfully predict individual movements in where the market will wander around before it finds out what it's waiting to find out.
