I had my entire Yolo portfolio in FD spy puts. Like, a lot of fucking money. $40k or so.


Futures opened and immediately fell off a cliff. Absolute insanity. This was well after the COVID drop, and during the recovery, so it wasn't expected. It was nuts. 

At the time, a limit down was -5%.

The indexes just kept dropping and dropping, and around 2am, we were actually about to limit down. I had already accepted that I was rich, as these were OTM FD puts, and if we opened at -5%, that $40k was gonna become like $500k, at least. Maybe more like a mil. I was sitting there looking at cars and houses and shit on the internet. 

So we're about to limit down, I'm sitting there watching and losing my shit. And just as it's about to limit down, the indexes bounced off of like -4.92%

And they fucking went green by open.

They fucking went green and I lost like $20k.

I know ""green by open"" is a meme, but it was legitimately the craziest thing I've ever seen, it made absolutely no sense, there was no catalyst for what happened. And, I learned that day that the market will always find new and innovative ways to rip your heart out and fuck you deep in the grunthole.
