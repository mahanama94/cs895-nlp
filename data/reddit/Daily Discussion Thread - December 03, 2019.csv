2019-12-03,wallstreetbets,f9kpnd1,"I'm going to give the **Magical Crayons TA** to help people decide what they'll do with their holdings, if it's any help at all.

We've broken through the first support in NQ that I had been outlining in previous posts, illustrated here. [We're currently hugging tight the second support and we've quite precisely fought up to it.](https://imgur.com/x4TR5mx) 

In regards to SPY, we hit the target I mentioned yesterday (307.3) this morning and [bounced off really well.](https://imgur.com/ptguRgL) That represents a ""completion"" of a correction and I told you all why I went into puts in [that same DD yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e55i33/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_03/f9iikni/)

307.3 remains the level to watch, but in regards to whether we'll keep dropping, what I'll say is I decided that I'll hold my puts at least overnight. The bounce we're having now is within expectations, as the former support (309.5) is now resistance until broken. 

The price action that will cause me to release the puts is a breach of the bottom of the flag from yesterday (~311) or if volume in the bullish direction begins to gain some steam-- whichever comes first. If we do ""retake"" the flag, I expect we will push towards a new ATH because it shows extreme bullish sentiment in the market. While selling momentum has slowed somewhat (and that goes for VIX momentum as well), projections indicate there is still a few more % to squeeze. I also note that it's not much further we can drop before there will be a strong reaction back up because too much further and it will cause shift into a neutral/bear-market, which I do not think will occur without confirmation of trade deal falling apart. As I mentioned earlier in the day, [that number in SPY is 304.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5fld1/daily_discussion_thread_december_03_2019/f9jvoek/). If we get close to that level I will exit all my put positions regardless unless the news I mentioned above does occur, which is the largest news-based catalyst I can foresee. Remember, we do have Fed-propping mechanisms still in place (and still available) to prevent too much slippage, so that will be max risk I am willing to handle for my puts.

If consolidation at these levels extends longer than a few days I also suggest exiting puts (i.e. before EOW), but I will keep you informed in the next post what I'm thinking. Either way, be careful out there, hold your tendies close, and wear a fucking condom okay? There's enough autists out there.",t3_e5fld1,16
