1584705930.0,2020-03-20,wallstreetbets,fl0gt2t,"Ya""ll are dumb. And you're all mostly right.

There are multiple things in play today.

1) Quad witching. Got it, Lots of puts and calls out there that want to get exercised will expire worthless. Which ones do you think MM 's want to expire worthless?

2) MM' s wrote a LOT puts that are now ITM expiring today. Do you think they want to go and have those be exercised? No, of course not! They made money off writing them they don't want to have to go and buy back shares to cover those.

3) Shorts covering. This has been happening every Friday since the end of February and causes a short squeeze.

So what's the order of operations here?

MM's will begin their bull rally around 2-3. This will be in an attempt to move the price higher to try and have as many ITM put options expire as possible. The  shorts will see this happening and will try and cover asap. This will have a backward effect and cause even more of  bull rally. Finally, the puts that are still ITM get exercised forcing MM""s to buy the underlying to cover causing even more of a rally.

The results? The most epic short squeeze ever.

SPY 270c 3/23, sell before 4. SPY 240p 4/17 buy after you sell your calls.

It simply means there will be more volume today. Typically, volatility isn't even impacted. There have been down days on witching days, in fact, two of the three March witching days in the the volatile 2007-2009 market were down days. Considering half of Q1 was bullish and half was bearish, open contracts will probably be forcing MMs in both directions. The first and final hour should see a lot of volume, but nobody knows which direction the momentum will be.

Don't panic and don't assume the quadraple witching guarantees a rally or drill. Trade appropriately given the trend and do not fucking FOMO.",t3_flt7ha,17

1584729169.0,2020-03-20,wallstreetbets,fl1hm9y,"Friday power hour DD mods won’t let through:


“Friday 3pm Pump - Shorts Consistently Covering (DD & Data Inside)

This has been posted before, but with today being Friday and the Triple Witch shit... here is the data points for the final power hour on the last 3 Fridays. 

All data is % return using 3pm-4pm hourly candle on Fridays. 

**3/13: $SPY +5.43%** (volume 62.67M / 329.57M total \~ 19% of daily volume)

**3/6: $SPY +2.21%** (volume 54.1M / 228.67M total \~ 23.66% of daily volume)

**2/28: $SPY +1.53%** (volume 51.22M / 385.76M total \~ 13.28% of daily volume)

Running theory is it is short sellers covering position over the weekend because of heightened volatility. 

So, the relationship between covering and volatility had me thinking - I wonder if this is at all correlated to $VIX. Theory is higher $VIX leads to greater anticipated weekend volatility which leads to greater short covering EOD.

**3/13: $VIX close 57.83** 

**3/6: $VIX close 41.94.** 

**2/28: $VIX close 40.11**

So, with $VIX close at 72 Thursday, the $SPY covering is going to be more drastic than 3/13 which means afternoon will have insane pump. 

Tl;dr $SPY 240c/250c/260c I won’t take my position until dip using TA most likely early/mid afternoon. “
