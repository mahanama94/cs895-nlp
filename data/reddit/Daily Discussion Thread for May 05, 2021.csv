Small caps are leading the move higher, with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%. Nasdaq is up 0.6%. S&P and Dow up about 0.3%. Russell and Nasdaq also saw the brunt of the damage yesterday, giving up almost 2% each.

We do get to hear from a couple of FOMC members: Eric Rosengren, Loretta Mester, and Charles Evans. Not sure if they‚Äôre taking questions but if so you can bet they‚Äôll be asked about Yellen‚Äôs comments. 

My thoughts on Yellen and the Fed: Need to listen to the audio. Not gonna type it.

ADP payrolls are due out at 0815. Economists expecting 800k jobs added in April, quite a bit more than the 517k from March. We also get ISM services data at 10am. These are a couple of key reports where the health of the economy is concerned. As always, you need to watch for the Goldilocks scenario: too hot and it means inflation and Fed tightening. Too cold and the economy is not recovering quickly or strongly enough. Though nowadays, maybe the ‚Äòtoo cold‚Äô scenario is preferred.

More earnings today as well: Hilton Worldwide just came out with a miss. GM, Allstate, and Etsy report later. After the bell we get Uber, Booking Holdings, and PayPal.",t3_n5cc1t,12
