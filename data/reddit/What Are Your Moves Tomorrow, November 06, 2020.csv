&#x200B;

1)Usually when buying cars in China it is not like in US... You need to be on a waitlist which isnt surprisng looking at their population. and you need to pay about 15K-20K USD just for the registration, and that is if you are lucky enough to get one. WITH NIO, the chinese can skip that.

2) NIO is backed by the chinese gov... NOONE CAN RUN LARHGE COMPANIES IN CHINA without the gov support. the gov literally created subsidies that assist NIO to sell CARS BY giving credits to people who purchase BATTERY SWAP CARS aka NIO not tESLA.

3) For those that think Chinese people would buy all TESLA and not NIO, understand that China becoming more and more patriotic over the years and they have been supporting their own brands MMORE THAN OUTSIDERS. More people buy HUAWEI phones than APPLE.

4) NIO's CEO has a history of being successful and relentless in Aiming High and succeeding. Just watch one video of his interview and you can see what a genuine Person he is, NO. B.S.

5) Their Finances are literally Increasing on the upside year by year

6) NIO has this little AI that speaks Chinese to the driver of the car set in the DASH BOARD. wHICH IS DIFFERENT, INnOVAtivE AND SETS nio APART FROM tesla

7) NIO is also backed by TEncent a company that has data from Chinese social media apps in order to collect massive data to help assist their development in their EV

8) LOOK AT THE DAMN CHART.",t3_jopz4v,26
