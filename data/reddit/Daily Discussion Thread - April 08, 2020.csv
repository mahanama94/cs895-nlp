1586359958.0,2020-04-08,wallstreetbets,fmspn3r,"Some food for thought. At its ATH on February 19 this year, the SP500 had a forward p/e of 19, which was only exceeded by the dot com bubble in 2000 when it was over 20. 

At SPY 270, we are back at a forward p/e of 19. The bullish argument is that this is SP500's ""fair"" valuation since it just takes us back to the same pre-crash ratio and the unlimited fiscal and monetary stimulus support p/e expansion.

We'll get a slightly clearer picture come earnings though. I personally think the 19 forward p/e is overestimating based on lagging data and when companies start to slash estimates, the forward p/e is going to balloon over 20 if we stay at 270. Fundamentals don't matter until they do and I think markets are overshooting on virus progress this week, much like it was overly pessimistic mid-March.
