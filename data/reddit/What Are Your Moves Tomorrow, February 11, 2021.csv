I see a lot of questions about options so I’m just going to give you some good cookie cutter advice that will more than likely save you from losing a fuck ton of money.

Personally I don’t touch puts, usually there is atleast one sector moving upward in the market and you should try to analyze those sectors. One thing we can speculate for now is that the primary sectors have shifted from big tech to energy and cannabis under the Biden administration. I do believe these sectors will be strong throughout the year and tech will do fine but probably won’t lead the pack this year.

Once you analyze the sectors you want to play with I usually will either do long calls and for long calls if you do your dd you can set them OTM (this means the strike price on the call is more than the current price) For example say plug power is $70 right now you could do a 6 month call with a strike price of $100.

The other type of call I like to make is about 2-3 weeks out and I will buy an ITM (this means the strike price is lower than the current amount). If you are doing 2-3 weeks out I like to pick a strike price a few dollars below the current price. For example if the current price is $70 for plug I could buy a $65 call that expires in 2-3 weeks.

This strategy will work pretty well for beginners and you guys can get some nice gains. As a tip, you can’t go broke taking profit and if you are a beginner doing 2-3 week out calls I would recommend selling when you get about 100% return which is fairly easy using this strategy and buying within energy and cannabis sectors as of late.",t3_lh3qli,102

GME is a very special situation with very special circumstances, (short interest, hedge fund interference). Other than the hype that went with it, AMC, BB, etc., it is more or less a stand alone play. GME did not have a chart above its previous high of $65ish.

Weed stocks are a sector play. They are moving because of news from a sector! The potential for decriminalization/legalization, mergers, etc. TLRY has been here before. It has a chart that was traded up to $300. This, like GME is not a pump and dump. The day traders have TLRY, and others, and are going to trade these charts. I am long TLRY, as I was back in 2018 when weed stocks had a surge.
