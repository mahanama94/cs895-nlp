You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‘Big Jay’. “This is your lucky day.” he whispers to you as he leans in close. “For a short time I’ve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you’ll be rich!” You smile and nod.

“Red” you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.

Since the initial crash at the end of March, the chart pattern has been pretty fucking consistent. We rally hard for 10 days and then correct for two. We also tend to dump at the end of the month. With that being said:

1. Stop fomo’ing into calls after a 10%, week long rally. Stonks only go up but learn that they need to breathe and pullback every once in a while. Does your dick still get hard after pumping it 7 times in a row? No. Same with stonks

2. Stop fomo’ing into FD puts once everything is crashing. You’re already late. Stop chasing the god damn train and wait for the next one. 

3. Hedge your shit. 

4. Buy the fucking dip. 

5. Learn some TA.

And yes I know patterns only become patterns after they form, but ride it until they stop working. 

Also, I know most of you will probably scoff at this post and continue making the same dumb fucking plays, but frankly I don’t give a shit. Just know that there’s plenty of us with half a brain on the sidelines laughing at your dumbass saying “I told you so”.",t3_grh1fv,23
