**They are splitting that 908 into 2 bills, one of which (the one likely to get blocked) having state and local aid.**

**Details below:**

 

A bipartisan group of lawmakers is readying a two-part proposal with $908 billion in pandemic relief to help boost the battered U.S. economy. They are planning to release it as soon as Monday so it can be considered by congressional leaders negotiating a final package that can be included in a government spending bill needed by Dec. 18.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone Sunday and plan to speak again Monday. The two have remained optimistic despite months of fruitless discussions.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested that Congress move forward with a bill that doesn’t include the two most controversial provisions: liability protection for employers from virus-related lawsuits and $160 billion in aid for state and local governments.

A bipartisan group of eight lawmakers plans to split up their $908 billion proposal and release two bills on Monday. One will include just liability protections and the aid for state and local governments. The other will include all the other provisions that have broad consensus, including aid for small businesses.

“We’ll have a bill produced for the American people” on Monday, Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, said on “Fox News Sunday.”",t3_kcioej,13

I’m convinced r/investing is like playing penny slots and saying it’s not gambling when they underperform the S&P500.

They’re just as speculative, except :

Everyone talks like they know shit, not a single would put money where their mouth is. 

Positions or Ban isn’t a thing because everyone a pussy to put their VOO positions. 

People paper hand any stock that’s not VOO/SPY/VTIX. 


In summary: 

WSB = where people call themselves retards are actually leading the trend and printing. Where people who are gambling are fucking honest that they are. 

r/Investing = where people think all options is gambling, think theta gang is roulette , think anything related to Greeks means getting fucked in the ass.
