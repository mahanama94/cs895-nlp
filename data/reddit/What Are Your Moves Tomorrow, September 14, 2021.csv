So the base effect on inflation should be diminishing in the August data. Yet there was no sign of a peak in this series during August, when it rose to 8.3%, with the goods component up 12.6% and the services component up 6.4%.
 
The CPI and PCED inflation rates track the PPI for personal consumption closely. The bad news is that the latter was up 7.4% during August, suggesting that July’s 5.4% and 4.2% increases in the CPI and PCED rose even more last month.
 
The only good news we can find on the inflation front is that the prices-paid indexes of the national M-PMI and NM-PMI seem to have peaked during June and July, respectively. The average of the two is down from 85.8 during June to 77.4 during August.

Inflation may be turning out to be more persistent and less transitory than expected by the Fed's doves, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",t3_pnn4wa,11
