1608586449.0,2020-12-22,wallstreetbets,ggmk6v3,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Today's another lesson in ""buy the dip, retard"" as the index all opened bigly down but recovered by intraday. At its day's low, the DOW was down more than -400 pts, S&P was -73 pts, and Chadsdaq was down -230 pts. Renew COVID fear punished morning paper hand tool bags as new strain of rona and UK lockdown prompted Europoors and others to panic sell. VIX skyrocketed up 30% much to WSB's chagrin. 
* Travel sector was especially punished at opening, as airline stocks took an initial big dive before slowly recovering from intraday lows. AAL closed the day down -2.48% at $16.10, DAL down -1.33% at $40.14, and UA finished flat at $15.09. This despite the new stimulus bill providing the industry with an additional 15 bil to restore jobs.
* Bank sector continues their Friday AH performance with JPM's share buyback announcement immediately after Fed easing of restriction. JPM close the day up 3.75%, BAC up 3.73%, WFC up 1.86%, and C up 3.67%. Along with NKE's strong ER last Fri and the recovery of AAPL and others, the DOW was propelled back into green territory during intraday thanks to financial sector and printer going brr.
* Over at S&P and Nasdaq, Tim Apple turned a more than -2% day around into a green day, while MSFT becomes a fucking semiconductor stock as it rallies more than 2%, well above their $222 resistance. MSFT closed the day at +1.83%. During last hour of trading, Apple faded red but reports broke of it looking into EV production as early as 2024, with multiple details on battery and lidar design, etc. Yes, Tim Apple is now also an EV stock. Shares immediately shot back into green to close the day up 1.24% to $128.24. Speculators should start hunting for their potential manufacturing partner as that is likely the next hyped ticker. 
*(In related news, VLDR pumped in closing minutes and AH thanks to Apple's ""iCar"" news as well, though there's no clear relationship between between the two company yet beyond lidar being cited as a technology Apple's car will eventually use).
* Gene editing/CRISP stock continues to rally. As mentioned in a [previous recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbb812/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gffzab5/), SGMO, EDIT, CRSP all soared today hitting new meme status. If you've missed out on EDIT it may already be too late given premium levels and valuation is now beyond typical WSB yolo. EDIT was up more than 40% for the day from previous close of $64.41 to intraday high of above $93. Profit taking eventually happened and EDIT closed the day up 29.89% at $83.66. Don't ask me about FOMO cuz all I have are SGMO shares instead of EDIT calls. Fuck.
* Despite flirting with talks of you-know-what over the weekend, Elon chan ended the day down -6.49% with TSLA closing at $649.86 after its first day of trading from SPX inclusion. No doubt this is still sky high value given pre-split that would be at  $3,249. Boomers like Vanguard are potentially left bagholding after probably loading up almost 50 bil worth during the last minute of trading last Friday at $695.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR went bigly green, breaking thru the $27 resistance yet again and finally closing the day well above $28. Shares are up 9.78% at $28.48. GME went red after initially opening green from heavy premarket action, clawing back from intraday low to end the day at $15.52, down slightly at -0.64%. Reports of Ryan Cohen adding in more shares made GME gang nut (upping his stake from 10% to 13%), despite underlying not moving much. The short squeeze is looking more and more real everyday though as shares availability continue to dwindle. For steel/MT gang, the stock initially opened red but closed the day flat/slightly green - up 0.17% at $23 even. Of note was that even during the morning -2% period, MT April+ call options faced little value change due to skyrocketing VIX/IV. It seems the market is definitely pricing in some form of catalyst within the next few months.
* Thanks to Tim Apple's late EOD EV pump, the DOW closed the day green up 36 pts at 0.12%, IXIC is slightly down -0.10%, SPX is down -0.39%, while RUT closed the day slightly green at 0.02%.
* Stimulus is all but confirmed, though votes are still pending as Congress is having computer problems with uploading the full text of the bill online (I'm not even shitting you), votes are expected later tonight at around 8-10pm ET.
