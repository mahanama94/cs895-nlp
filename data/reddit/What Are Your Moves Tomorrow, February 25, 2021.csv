That way we don't have to change anything or add flairs and we still filter out small potatoes posts and pictures of objects that have nothing to do with trading.

1614225057.0,2021-02-25,wallstreetbets,goo16ap,"Would love some added context on the EOD trading halt. That halt lasted 14 minutes (until market closed). That's the first halt to happen on GME that lasted more than five minutes.

Full history can be viewed here: https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts

The official exchange rules say that halts on single securities are limited to five minutes, while indexes can be longer (starting at 15 minimum). The rule about 5 minute halts can be viewed here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp

IMO something happened EOD that shut trading down for longer than normal. I don't know what because I don't know anything, but I have war flashbacks of late January and I'm pretty sure it never halted more than five mins based on my memory and the records.
