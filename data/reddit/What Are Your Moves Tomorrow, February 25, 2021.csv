Full history can be viewed here: https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts

The official exchange rules say that halts on single securities are limited to five minutes, while indexes can be longer (starting at 15 minimum). The rule about 5 minute halts can be viewed here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp

IMO something happened EOD that shut trading down for longer than normal. I don't know what because I don't know anything, but I have war flashbacks of late January and I'm pretty sure it never halted more than five mins based on my memory and the records.
