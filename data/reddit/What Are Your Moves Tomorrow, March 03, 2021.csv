They're phone normies. The new reddit signup process on the app, in the name of reducing bounce rate and signup friction, will choose a name for you using that pattern. You don't even have to type a username, you can just hit next and it gives you one.

Just sayin, give our new homies a break, they're not all beep boops. If you believe the men at the top, there are hardly any bots here. I'm sure there's a couple but... I find most spam bots aren't that competent. It's hard to emulate genuine reta-retail traders.",t3_lwce20,1

Short interest dropped like a rock from 9.5% 2/19 to 2.59% yesterday according to Ortex, and Aunt Cathie just added another 3.3M shares to ARKK. Goldman's strong upgrade and price target increase from $13 to $34 doesn't seem like it's been fully priced in yet (jumped from $25-29 after announcement on 2/17 but came right back down). Seems like everyone expects this to get back on the 🚀

There's been resistance at $28-30 forever but there was brief support at $31-32 when it was going nuts - I think 4/1 27c @ $1.61 could be a reasonable short term bet for some modest gains with the chance for significant upside if the hype train gets rolling again.
