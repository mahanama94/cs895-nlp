The stock market is still booming. The meat sweatshops continue humming with meat. The toilet paper factories are pumping out paper almost as fast as our magnificent Federal Reserve Bank.

Only 25%-30% percent are unemployed, and they're all going back to work soon! Many excellent governors are opening up their states, and these unemployed will roll up their sleeves and get back to work. They're well taken care of and received their $1,200 checks. It's safe now that we stopped the spread of the virus, and people will stay 6 feet apart from each other.

Mission Accomplished – only a million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and about 60,000 dead. Pretty much just like the seasonal flu that goes around every year. There is nothing to be worried about! The situation is so under control, we don't even need to continue testing. In fact, there aren't even testing kits and equipment to test. It doesn't matter anyway. Everything is ok now.

>**Bears will require material new negatives for them to not concede, if U.S. equities don’t come off their highs very soon.**

* This week has laid out all the most important markets facts:
* The global economic impact has been devastating
* Moral hazard isn’t a relevant concern for policy makers, and their willingness to prop up financial markets should not be underestimated
* Earnings season is making clear that, for most companies, guidance is worse than useless; there’s no clarity on quite how bad it will be for many firms
* No matter how optimistic you are on the virus, U.S. stocks are expensive

>But valuations don’t matter for retail investors -- they have bought the narrative that central banks will do whatever it takes until the virus quashed.  
>  
>Crucially, however, hedge fund equity-shorts remain near a multi-year extreme because they do care about valuations. I’m in that bearish camp. The problem for us is that the time has come for that bearish view to be proven correct -- we are now seeing the terrible economic data and companies with gloomy projections.
