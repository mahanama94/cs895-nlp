“I’m about to go treat myself to a McDonald’s breakfast” - Autist in WSB daily thread


A simple pleasure that’s timeless imo. One of the nicest things one can do for themselves and quite easy/cheap for the amount of happiness you will receive.

I personally love staying up all night trading stocks in Singapore and then walking to McDonald’s as soon as the sun rises and have my self a nice sausage and egg McMuffin meal. The hash brown should be eaten first imho as it’s best eaten hot, whereas the McMuffin is much less dependent on temperature. I like to get an orange juice with the foil lid, something about popping that straw through and sucking up liquid sunshine really puts me at ease.

Depending on how I did in the Asian markets I might decide to walk back home and go to sleep just as the average sucker is getting up and getting started on the rat race.

If I lost money, the delightful McDonalds breakfast made me forget about it and completely buoyed my spirits.

But the markets are now opening in New York and something occurs to me; an epiphany...

**-- TLDR is down below --**

Just gonna start spitting facts cuz i know were all retarded here.

* GameStop has a 97% short float right now.
* 56 million float - 54.3 million shares short
* Today, someone **covered 250k** shares - It sent **GameStop up 12%**

Source: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

Recent Data

32.1 % **350,000** 2020-**06-08 10:15:02**

31.1 % **100,000** 2020-**06-08 08:00:03**

***What would happen if 54.3 MILLION shares were purchased due to a squeeze?***

**Important Dates:**

**6/9 Earnings Report**

**6/12 Annual Shareholder meeting**

Out of all of the **Retard Retail™** pumps weve seen over the last 1-2 weeks. SAVE, PLAY, MGM, HTZ, CCL, AAL.... GameStop has had an average price of **$4.20** and hasnt moved much in about 30 days.

**The 1500% increase in Sales:**

Guano Flu has resulted in a record setting quarter for video game sales with GameStop seeing 1500% increase.

Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-video-game-spending-idUSFLMKyQGy](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-video-game-spending-idUSFLMKyQGy)

**So why would they move now?**

The short interest has been stupidly high prior to Bat Scratch Fever. The borrow rates as you can see above have been approx. 30% but whats happening? Two things:

1. The bond holders are shorting Gamestop shares as a hedge against BK
2. Large retail/institutional holders are enjoying a JUICY 30% borrow rate by lending out their shares

*Ok retard, speed it up...*

Gamestop issued new bonds, which have a 2023 maturity. The bonds are up +20% in 48 hours. Signaling theres interest for them, which means Gamestop IS NOT AT RISK FOR BK AND HAS CASH, LIKELY THROUGH 2023.

* **Bond holders have no reason to continue shorting shares as a hedge and paying insane borrow rates**
* **Large holders have no reason to continue to lend shares**

**The Console Cycle**

Sony and MSFT are releasing new consoles this year - if the stock is not going CH11, then the console cycle ( Gamestop's largest margin/sqft items ) has not been even remotely priced in. The reveal was supposed to be 6/4 but with the BLM hijacking all media outlets its been postponed. Should be within the next few weeks bulding further hype.

GameStop is currently trading at 1/2 BOOK VALUE.

This is because everyone has become incredibly confident they are going to be forced into BK

But after doing 4:20 mins of DD ive realized that just aint happening chief.
