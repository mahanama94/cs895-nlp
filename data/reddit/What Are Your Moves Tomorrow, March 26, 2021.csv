Trying to take control of the company, both parties combined bought over 94% of the float. At the same time, other investors were heavily shorting the stock (to sell to one of the parties), until at one point everyone realized that they won't be able to cover their short position because Morgan/Hill and Harriman won't sell their shares. 

The shorts were squeezed as they fought for the remaining 6% of the shares and drove NP from $20 to $1000 a share (which corresponds to over $31K in today's dollars). 

To pay for the high covering share prices, the shorts liquidated their other positions, causing mass panic that rippled through the whole stock market. 

Overwhelming cries of ""sell! sell! sell!"" were heard at the NYSE trading floor. Temporary relief were provided when rumors of Morgan's broker's death were spread, but quickly dissipated and the panic resumed. The whole ordeal concluded only when the two parties reached a truce and the shorts were finally able to cover their position.
