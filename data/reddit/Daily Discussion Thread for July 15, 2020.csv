I gotta say, it does kinda suck that everyone's reaction is to assume we're doing something nefarious, we're stupid enough to let the sub get shut down, and that everyone didn't immediately realize to give him a really, really stupid ticker and enjoy watching him blow up live. It's not like any money changed hands. The sub isn't going to evaporate.

Are we just never gonna let any big e-tards in here if they're not Martin Shkreli? Personally I would've loved watching pokimane get the robinhood opening bell sweats and waste a bunch of simp money live. C'est la vie. I'm checking out for the day since this has been a shitshow. Good luck.

Plus, none of those tards would've been able to post for a month or so anyway. And the burden is on us to moderate it. We always get the best posts from complete noobs with too much money. They rarely bring 100k.",t3_hrkzcb,1
