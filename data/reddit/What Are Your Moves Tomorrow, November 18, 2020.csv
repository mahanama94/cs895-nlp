The Bear nods and makes his way to the roulette table.

Sitting at the table is another Bull. The bear can hardly see the Bull who is buried behind a fat stack of chips. The Bull says to the Bear, “Psst, this table is rigged. It’ll land on black every time.”

The Bear gives a thumbs up and exchanges cash with the dealer for some chips.

The dealer says to the Bear, “Welcome to the table, my name is Jerome. It’s your lucky night, because I’ve rigged the table for everyone and it absolutely ALWAYS lands on black.”

With a sly wink and a smile, Jerome says “So, Mr Bear, where should I place your chips?”

The Bear winks back knowingly and says, “Red”.

It lands on black.
