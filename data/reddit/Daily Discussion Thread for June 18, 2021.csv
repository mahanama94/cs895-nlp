More often than not they're coming from a single place that is increasingly growing comfortable with posting the links to single submissions with the intent of getting their users to come hassle us and try to convince us their stock is the way.

Do me a favor and report that when you see it. It's against the site rules and fucking annoying because random submissions turn into hostile territory and are decidedly *not* wallstreetbets anymore.",t3_o2lk48,1
