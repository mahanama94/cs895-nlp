I'm glad more people are coming to realize the unreal potential for homebuilding stocks, as I've been screaming about it for a bit now. 

I actually wrote about the Lennar/CCS play here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar\_like\_good\_god\_ccs\_is\_making\_me\_hot\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar_like_good_god_ccs_is_making_me_hot_and/) 

Although, I ultimately sold my Lennar calls the day before earnings for a small profit as I had to exercise SOME risk management. I was on almost 27K margin across various plays (Commons and options across a few stocks), and had to deleverage for my own peace of mind (plus i was looking at Lennar to give me guidance on CCS/Homebuilders, even though I already knew it was going to be a great earnings beat). 

After the Lennar Earnings, and the economic data I wrote this piece here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs\_the\_company\_making\_a\_shit\_ton\_of\_cash/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs_the_company_making_a_shit_ton_of_cash/) 

I ultimately prefer CCS because it's undervalued in terms of trailing p/e and forward p/e and is simultaneously projecting higher revenue growth compared to Lennar and pretty much any other name (with the exception of one or two stocks), with a dividend yield that's comparable. I also am pretty sure it's going to beat it's EPS estimate like it has the other 5 quarters. It also dropped much harder than other home builder stocks. 

With that said, I think the sector as a whole is poised for a strong golden age in the next 5 years (at absolute minimum) and you could pick any homebuilder and make a ton of money.",t3_o5tbpf,23

1624493714.0,2021-04-11,wallstreetbets,h2tw38u,"In case you weren't paying attention to the zoomed out actions of today, the housing report that came out earlier this morning was positive, but not as positive as the wider market would like. Additionally, everything dumped this afternoon. I'm assuming the AH dump was a preemptive reaction to fears of lackluster earnings or just negative drag from the earlier report. 

Having said that, if you look at Pennyether's previous DDs, they're always well researched, full of warnings, and generally lucrative if you time them properly. 

No one forced you to make your trades. If you still have the conviction that you had reading the DD, stick by your guns and don't judge a stock by its AH movements. None of your calls are expiring for a few weeks and your shares aren't going anywhere, so just see what tomorrow brings.

Pros:
Good stock with good PE ratio and PB ratio.
Good potential for 50% growth in 12 months. 
Strong balance sheet, good positive cash flows. 
Notes are payable at the end of year, so current liabilities are not so current, as a result current ratio is good.
Cons:
Only related to Call options: The stock will grow but the timing is unknown. IMHO with current premium your options will not print. I would and probably will purchase longer options or use options to exercise them.

The bubble in housing was not really in the building of homes, it was in the financing being made available for homes. People did want the houses, they just couldn't afford them, and for the various reasons we all know well now, the banks and mortgage brokers didn't care and lent anyway.

I would be concerned that companies like KBH are building up houses for people who are taking out excessive amounts of debt to buy something way overpriced, and in an era of an unexpected jump in inflation, will not be able or willing to pay. And then when the biggest asset they own has lost value, they are going to be cash strapped later on. Maybe KBH doesn't care as long as they get paid. But then, the question, is KBH sure they are getting paid? I guess what I wanna know is, how do you know people will keep getting financing as prices keep going up? 

I will concede that the demand might stay around for a while as at least partial remote work becomes permanent at far more places than before. I will also concede that what I said doesn't matter for a short term play. But I don't really do short term plays.",t3_o5tbpf,3

Buying options are risky on this thinly traded stock so after today's dive I sold $45 CSPs for Aug 20. The same dive happened after Q1 earnings and then the market realized ""oh shit, there's a housing shortage and the market is still super hot.""

One thing I would say as cautionary is that states KBH operates within are notoriously difficult to get permitting for housing. So it naturally slows the build process and thus you get less volume. Earnings were probably better than expected because the national home builders actually stockpile lumber and copper and so when the futures market exploded they could tap reserves and ignore the volatility. The revenue numbers are more concerning, but in the end, this stock is off its mkt cap highs and can rally long-term.

Have you, or anyone reading this, looked into LGIH? They build multi-unit housing in FL and TX  (notoriously easy permit application) which are both seeing inflows of residents. I like the play not just from a rotational perspective, but also because 99% of the float is owned by institutions, they have 9% SI, and only have 25mm shares outstanding. It could see a pretty fast runup once retail tries to pile in.",t3_o5tbpf,3

I was curious about this before posting, and read about people talking about them here on Reddit. Mixed reviews. I checked that review website and they are rated very highly.. but it sounds like that only applies to house while it's new.

Lennar became investment grade this year, and a slew of other home building companies are poised to become so as well after being upgraded a rung below. Between the note interest rates and the ability to not use the revolving line of credit, when that happens they can either refinance the debt for much cheaper or just pay it off early. The thing with the last few years was interest income took such a large part of the potential net income, but now these companies have deleveraged significantly and are bound to have no net debt to homebuilding debt.

1624430684.0,2021-04-11,wallstreetbets,h2qqo2c,"> For real though, there aren't really any signs there is a bubble.

Yo, Jamie Dimon himself said that there is a bubble in housing prices.

Ask yourself, there has been a global real estate boom. Every single country on the planet is seeing massive real estate price increases. Then, ask yourself what links every country together in 2020? If you said central banks printing currency like it is going out of style, you would be correct. 

The supply/demand curve explanation here is the same facile one that every real estate agent all over the country is hyping. The fact is that the median household income cannot afford the median home price, so what we are seeing are people: a) getting over-extended to buy their own house at ridiculously low interest rates, or b) getting over-leveraged to buy investment properties.

Ultimately, I don't think MBS will go bust this time around because the Fed itself owns like $2T of it (about 20% of the market) directly. However, if the corporate debt bubble pops and everyone who thought their cushy desk job was so safe when waiters lost their livelihoods will find out very quickly who is expendable if C-suite bonuses are on the chopping block due to bunk earnings. 

Essentially, this is a cheap debt fueled bonanza which has completely gone beyond idiotic. How in the hell can you explain real estate going up 20% during a year when 20M people lost their jobs for at least some period of time?",t1_h2ou9vf,1

I'm grateful for the info you are providing here, it really illuminates just how many blind spots I have, which will help me improve as an investor.

Like I said before, I'm bullish on most of the builders, but I saw KBH had some immediate catalysts coming up, and it has earnings a month before the pack (minus LEN). So I dug into it first and liked what I saw.  But, I'm curious -- which builders do you think have the most upside for, say, the next 3 months (assuming demand is as insanely bullish as it appears)?

I was aware of the fundamentals and the macroeconomic factors for housing therefore, and so when i saw the steep drop in homebuilding stocks, i researched the most undervalued ones based on fundamentals.

I also looked at the commodity prices for homebuilding, to see if that was the cause, but there was only good news there. 

So i decided to dive in on a stock that was trading cheaply compared to its peers, while having better PEG.",t1_h2q3w7r,1

1624399634.0,2021-04-11,wallstreetbets,h2p9lpw,"Thank you so much for this. I had heard that KB build quality varies from region to region, based on who they get to build. But it sounds like you're saying KB uses cheap materials, which I imagine are all the same for their models across the nation. Sucks, and if I'm ever in the market to buy I'll take your feedback into account!

But their reviews are great. So I guess the takeaway is to not trust that review site, lol.

I'm pretty new to the whole residential construction industry... I've spent only 30-40 hours researching, and mostly the macro conditions and technicals -- basically what you see in the DD. I did not have time to do a comparison between all the publicly listed companies (KBH has catalysts coming up).

Thanks for ranking these homes. Besides random redditors, would you know of a good source to get a sense of the build quality of these various companies? Or maybe Reddit is the way to go (I could head over to /r/construction or something)",t1_h2p8d3s,3

Earnings are up, and they're selling and filling their backlog faster than was projected, which just means faster future growth.

  
I think the real answer is that the stock pumped a bit pre-earnings because of it's newly minted semi-meme status, and Wall Street used the earnings as their opportunity to cash out short term profit. I'd hazard a guess that they also took full advantage of the 75% spike on call premiums the moment this DD was posted and have an incentive to protect their positions.",t1_h2v7cuc,2

They're the ones you want to get if you're into deep value. CCS has a dividend, but M/I homes is one rung higher in the debt rating (lowest form of investment grade, versus highest ranked non investment grade). While i expect CCS to get upgraded to investment grade, that's where they sit right now.

It’s so hard to say overall because a lot of times you don’t know fully until years out and these neighborhoods are planned years ahead of time. I think that sub is a good place to start.
