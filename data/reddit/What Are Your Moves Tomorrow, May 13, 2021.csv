Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Inflation is devaluing currency, right? Makes our dollars have less buying power for goods. But you know what’s *not* experiencing inflation? 

*Dave and Buster’s tickets*.

That’s right. We take out substantial personal loans. Take 50% and buy D&B play cards, hit up Ski Ball or that game where you put a token down the ramp and launch it into stuff for points (that shits how you get the *real* moolah) and take in that sweet sweet square chain of consumerism which we trade for Pelotón treadmills or whatever it is they sell there these days. 

Now you may be asking “what happened to the other 50% of the loan?” 

We buy $PLAY calls, that’s what. Boom. Making money going in *and* coming out. Paying ourselves for tickets. Everybody goes home with a stoned Rasta banana plushie, a belly full of appetizers, a vehicle full of soon to be re-sold electronics, and a portfolio full of green.",t3_naxw3d,13

70F Sunny, Clear skies

A portrait composed of inappropriate humor, airbrushed in stripes of pinkest pink, sprinkled with irrational exuberance, and adorned with the levity to laugh at yourself and circumstances, make for a diamond set of armor against the monotonously gray daily grind and daunting sense of futile responsibility of being an adult. Sometimes it is necessary to simply return home, take off the mask of falsehoods, of choreographed smiles and pleasantry, and just laugh at the cruel humor that the day, month, and years have dealt you, as if you were still a teen.

Perhaps it was u/angrysc0tsman12 who pushed me over the edge, or maybe it was simply u/sloptart69. Either way, we must stop clinging to the comfortable continuity of the daily grind. Just stop passively watching the grays of the day wash away, blending itself indistinguishably into the next, as days become months, then years.",t3_naxw3d,10

1620886956.0,2021-05-13,wallstreetbets,gxy7gkv,"I bought options everyday at close had just 1k. Somehow everyday 4 days out of 5 I made a profit.


I kept regambling. Buy at close selll at open. 

Sure there were losses but the gains outweighed em

I reached 25 k… then 40. It took me 3 months.

And in one day my account blew up.

Can anyone loan me 1k again? 🤣

Edit: this was during the time Tesla jumped from 300 to 900. 

What fucked me was that since I was a cockroach I didn’t know the bigger options that I ended buying on 25k which reached 40k that night were illiquid. I fucking kept selling and no one bought it till I was fucked.",t3_naxw3d,10
