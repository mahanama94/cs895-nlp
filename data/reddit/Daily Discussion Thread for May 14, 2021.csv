1620988642.0,2021-05-14,wallstreetbets,gy31li0,"Futures are continuing their rally, with tech stocks leading the way. The Nasdaq is up 1.1%. Russell 2000 0.7% higher. S&P 500 0.6% to the good and Dow Industrials ahead by 0.4%. That’s as of 0625.

This follows a day of nice gains for risk assets. There was a reversal after some pre-market selling. At the close the major indexes were up 1% and change (except for the Nasdaq, which gained only 0.7%).

No immediate indication what’s driving the relief rally, but I have my ideas. You have to listen to the podcast though. Not gonna type it.

Stocks have a bunch of ground to make up to turn green for the week. Nasdaq is still down 4.6% for the week. S&P almost 3% in the red. Dow down 2%. 

Couple of data releases today. Retail sales at 0830. Expectation is for a 0.8% increase in April, a major slowdown from the 9.8% advance in March. Industrial production at 0915 will shed some light on supply-chain bottlenecks.

Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Good luck out there today, retards.",t3_nc4z12,72
