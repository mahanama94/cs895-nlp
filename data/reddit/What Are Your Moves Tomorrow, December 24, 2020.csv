Step 1: Noticing the individual tickers aren’t moving anywhere in your diversified portfolio so you begin to sell them for small profit or loss. Ie, index and etfs. 

Step 2: you begin to buy the individual stocks that was in those etfs that was over performing hoping to catch more upside. 

Step 3: You turn into option on those stocks because shares are moving to slow. 

Step 4: Realize you need more excitement in your life and trading is no longer interesting unless your portfolio goes +/- 10% daily. 

Step 5: Welcome home.",t1_ggu9xi3,12

Can you and zjz and fuzzy and the other old schoolers start an ACTUAL wallstreetbets sub that we neophytes have to perform dangerous and possibly homoerotic stunts to join?

I've lurked here since December last year. I've been actively following since February.  I've heard the legends from the oldschoolers about what WSB used to be.
