1618225448.0,2021-04-12,wallstreetbets,gu8pory,"Futures are a bit lower this morning, with major indices in the U.S. all down about 0.2% to 0.3% as of 0645. Not much action in the bond market — 10-year yields holding steady around 1.657%. Asia is seeing a bit of selling, with stock markets in China and Hong Kong down about 1%. The Nikkei in Japan is down about 0.8%. This all follows another record close for stocks on Friday. 

This week stands to be the busiest in some time with first quarter earnings season kicking off. That isn’t until Wednesday though, when the banks report. Before that we have CPIs on Tuesday. A bunch of Fed honchos are speaking this week, perhaps as a result of the inflation report.

We already had Powell last night on 60 minutes. It does look a bit like the Fed may be preparing for a spike in inflation with Powell saying “we're at a place where the economy is about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly,"" due to vaccines and fiscal support.

Not sure that will matter if tomorrow’s CPI numbers exceeds expectations. But we’ll deal with that tomorrow. Speaking of expectations, the forecast for earnings is quite positive indeed — maybe too positive. But we’ll deal with that on Wednesday and later in the week.

So for now it’s another day of wait-and-see, and of course pontificate. No shortage of that. Big picture it still doesn’t seem to make all that much sense to bet against the market.",t3_mpao84,99
