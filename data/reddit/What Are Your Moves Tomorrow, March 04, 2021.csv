i finally complained enough for my dad to buy a new monitor, a 17 inch beauty.  the colors were so vivid!  Team 2 was red, and I recall my first game with that new monitor, it was the most beautiful, vibrant color i had ever seen.  for some reason, over the years, the memory of that feeling has stuck with me.
