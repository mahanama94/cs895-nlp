He opened up the spreadsheet ""fed_stimulus_v4.6_final_finaldraft"" and looked at the only two entries on the spreadsheet: cell A1 said ""Stimulus"" and cell B1 was a number so large it wouldn't display properly in the cell. He clicked on the number and added two extra zeros at the end and then closed the spreadsheet.

He wiped the sweat off his forehead and sighed. Who knew saving the economy would be so hard? But his work was not quite done, because the equity markets needed rescue as well. The Dow only went up 10% last week, and that was dangerously low.

Jerome opened up Safari and went to Robinhood.com

""Chad, you're a young techie guy. Can you help me set up this Robinhood account?"" Chad was the new office intern, and each of the ladies in the office went down on him faster than the S&P 500 in February.

""I'm busy right now. Why don't you do it yourself and tell me about it later,"" Chad said as he pulled his dick out and showed it to three ladies passing by in the hallway, each of whom fainted as all the blood in their bodies rushed to their engorged vaginas.

Jerome went through the account registration process and transferred $2 trillion. He knew if he could just pump important equities like SPCE and F he could save the economy, but there was a problem.

""Chad! I need your help! This bullshit website says something about an instant deposit?""

Chad turned around, swinging his 9 inch flacid monster dangerously close to his boss's face.

""Oh yeah, you're limited to like $50k instant deposits. That website is for fucking autists.""

""The trump administration has discussed a mandated shutdown of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico due to the coronavirus spreading among workers on offshore platforms, according to people familiar with the matter. 

It is unclear whether the proposal, which comes as several workers on oil platforms test positive for the new virus, is still under serious consideration. But shuttering gulf platforms over health concerns would also have the effect of curtailing US oil production amid a world-wide glut of oil that has sent prices plummeting.

If the US shut down all Gulf of Mexico production, it would cut about two million barrels a day from overall US production of about 13 million barrels a day. Such forced cut would be controversial with many in the oil industry, the people said. 

An Interior Department spokesman declined to comment on a potential offshore shutdown. The White House also declined to comment""",t3_fu6gsh,10
