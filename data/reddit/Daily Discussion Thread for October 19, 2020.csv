1603130123.0,2020-10-19,wallstreetbets,g9ckyiu,"Alright. For everyone clamoring about a stimulus deal, it is highly unlikely. The Republicans 500 billion deal is absolute garbage. No 1200 checks, no money to state and local government and a business/school liability shield. The lack and inclusion of these provisions means the bill is certainly dead on arrival. 

‚ÄúBut But the Mango says ...‚Äù Republicans are distancing themselves from the president now. A lot of them are worried about their future in politics if they‚Äôre aligned with the Mango. Look at Graham, no way I thought he‚Äôd possibly lose his seat. 

Further, a lot of Republicans see a Trump victory becoming less and less likely. If the Democrats win the election, Republicans are going to pivot to austerity measures. We‚Äôre already seeing this with their reluctance to even support then Mango‚Äôs 1.8 trillion deal.

So what does this all mean? No stimulus until the election. Perhaps no stimulus if the Republicans maintain the majority in the senate post-election.
