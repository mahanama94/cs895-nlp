1582125344.0,2020-02-19,wallstreetbets,fi3qb05,"Re: Pumping

Recently, we looked into a number of users accused of shilling.

We take pumping seriously and try to stamp it out whenever possible, to the point of blacklisting tickers. 

In this case, we couldn't find anything worth banning over.

That said, if anyone has more evidence showing it was a coordinated pump, please feel free to slide into my DMs. 

Warmly Regards,

If it plays out like I think, autist will jump off tomorrow, the share price will drop, the regular folks will panic sell, and that will send the share price plummeting even more until all that is left is bag holders and those who are going long.

1582142536.0,2020-02-19,wallstreetbets,fi4jons,"I have a theory. VW just announced it's ended all participation in gasoline powered racing. In case you're unaware, VW is huge, and has a massive influence over the automotive scene.

I have a feeling, as well as many others, that internal combustion engine (ICE) motorsports are going to take a pretty big hit from this. And if you're familiar with the car world, you know that racing has a huge impact on consumer cars in the form of new technologies. Much of the RND applied there makes it to us.

Without the world's largest automaker participating in ICE racing for the sake of greener appearances, I think other automakers will follow suit.

What this would potentially mean is the racing world transitioning into electric. A robust electric racing scene would translate into much faster, and more aggressive RND into electric. Better efficiency is key here to go more laps with less charge, aerodynamics improve efficiency, new ways of restoring energy in ways similar to regenerative braking, etc. These will eventually find their way into their consumer vehicles making electric better, and this more popular, faster.

The other big thing is, if people can see electric racecars outperforming their ICE counterparts, people who may not otherwise like the idea of electric will start to see the hype and arguments for electric.

All this to say, the VW announcement, in conjunction with things like Mercedes stopping further development of ICE vehicles, I think that electric is going to be showing up much faster than people originally thought.

the most important thing for electric to work is good infrastructure. That's the one weakness right now. So I say, start backing electric vehicle infrastructure.

I just bought up a large amount of BLNK (Blink Technologies) which is currently the only publicly traded electric vehicle charging infrastructure company. It's also the largest, boasting more charging stations and technologies than any other charging company.

So far, since the VW announcement, I'm up about 30%

Food for thought!




TL;DR Edit: I think VW's pulling out of electric vehicle racing is going to force electric vehicle adoption faster, urging other carmakers to follow suit, and electric vehicle infrastructure is the place to put your money. Give BLNK a look.",t3_f69d94,7

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-18/virgin-galactic-frenzy-starting-to-look-a-little-like-tesla-run

> Derivatives that can extract even more gains from Virgin Galactic have become a favorite among retail investors, judging by activity on message boards like r/wallstreetbets. When a fresh option is written, a dealer who sells it will typically hedge their exposure by buying a certain amount of the stock so as not to accumulate a short position, and will tend to buy more shares in the event of a continued rally. Some traders have seized onto this dynamic as evidence that their options-buying activity is sufficient to perpetuate a rally in the underlying stock.
