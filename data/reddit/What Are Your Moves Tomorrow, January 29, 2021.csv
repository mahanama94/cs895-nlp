tl;dr: we have always been retarded but this is the least retarded we have EVER BEEN.

No fucking crayons in this post. Let's look at this from a historical angle. I have been lurking since literally 2014, when this sub was filled with people posting loss porn and when people still thought the f bomb was funny and when threads weren't constant bickering between bull and bear shills

The most iconic WSB moments have also been some of the biggest collective GUHs that we have experienced as a sub. I was here when everyone was on the RAD WBA merger bullshit, when we literally thought that piece of shit RAD stock was going to MOOON to $5 per share. I lost $10K on that trade myself. I have been here for ir0nyman, and I've seen TWO separate instances of MSFT $200 tanking the entire stock market.

We are retards, easily excitable ones at that. In the past, we've gotten hyped about things that have been fully outside of the control of any retail trader. It's like, fucking free will. No matter how much we wanted those $200 4/19 puts to pan out (oh how convenient, money printer go BRRRRR), or how certain we were about quad witching (what a lame friday), the MMs and institutions ALWAYS WON. They have always been the ones to decide the rules, decide how we play. They have been the puppeteers controlling our smooth brain moves, all the while making us THINK that we had free will and an ability to make money in a RIGGED market. IMAGINE Lebron trying to win the championship for cleveland knowing that every ref had slammed GSW ML -180 with their kids' college funds

Today, we stand in the same position that michael burry, jared vennett, ben rickert, etc etc did before the 2008 financial crisis. We have collectively identified institutions that have bit off WAY more than they can chew, and they are doing everything they can to continue rigging the market to weasel their way out. Go watch the wolf of wallstreet tonight, pay for it on amazon prime with the tendies you've made from GME. DO YOU SEE THE PARALLELS? A clear case for the downfall of a multitude of financial institutions who made irresponsible, overexposed bets and thought they'd never have to pay.

MAKE THEM PAY. THEY ARE TRYING TO RIG THE MARKETS BUT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE TO A BUNCH OF RETARDS AND THEIR WIVES' BOYFRIENDS. WE LIKE THIS STOCK, AND WE ARE NOT FUCKING SELLING AND WE ARE NOT FUCKING LEAVING.",t3_l78od1,576

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

We're fighting for our right to our gainz.

And should we win the day, January 29 will no longer be known as an ordinary day, but as the day when the wsb world declared in one voice:

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK 

#5,000+💎🙌🏻🚀

1611868008.0,2021-01-29,wallstreetbets,gl5a4h4,"Guys, just wanted to say (with real tears in my eyes) that I fecking love you.

Got a bit late on the $GME train, but it has a feeling of purpose that no other trade I've ever done has given me. This may be one of the last times we can make history, and I'm really proud of being part of it.

For around 3 years I've felt that my life was going nowhere, from terrible jobs to terrible relationships and friends leaving out of the blue. It hasn't all been bad of course, but somehow I've felt that there were a lot more things on the ""bad"" side than on the ""good"".

Now if we can pull this off, I'll be able to financially help my mother and maybe even have some left for a fresh start, but if we can't pull it off just the feeling of sticking it up those pigs will have been enough.

WIN OR LOSE I WILL COME OUT STRONGER FROM THIS AND IM SURE YOU GUYS WILL AS WELL

Robinhood Financial LLC 85 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 United States

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.
