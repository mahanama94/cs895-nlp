1623183560.0,2021-06-09,wallstreetbets,h12jw2b,"A few thoughts:

1. Stocks are worth whatever people will pay for them (an agreed upon fact)
2. All through school millennials & younger people were constantly told over and over (by silent generation and boomers) that they had to invest in order to have a comfortable life/retire
3. boomers call the current market ""frothy"" and ""unsustainable"" and ""detached from fundamentals""
4. What if this is just the new normal? More people than ever have started investing for the first time. And what do they buy? Companies they know and love
5. Explain to me why this is the fault of an average retail trader

Not saying this shit won't crash but I am saying there is pretty big possibility that we are just entering a new normal in the market due to education & technology making it easier to trade than ever before. Don't fight the ocean just ride the waves",t3_nvcwpz,22
