1615239673.0,2021-03-09,wallstreetbets,gq9c3it,"Hey everyone, I see concerns about trash memes and whatnot. Wanted to share some data with you.

First, I don't like trash memes either, but I also don't like being the arbiter of what's funny or not, so I tried to make a system that removed my judgment and was mostly based on user feedback. You'll notice the somewhat new comments it leaves when it says the feedback wasn't good enough. That's this script.

So, Memes along with two other flairs are culled by a script that runs every 5 minutes and checks if the upvote ratio and total upvotes as a function of time are high enough to consider it ""dank"". That can mean it has universal frontpage appeal and isn't very WSB, but it also means that most memes that nobody finds funny are auto removed.

Here's some data about the number of memes posted per day and whether they're approved or not.

[A zoomed out view including the popularity pop](https://i.gyazo.com/6565f3e0e205fe2c6978058a94ff176d.png)

[A zoomed in view of recently, labeled](https://i.gyazo.com/4c25521fd7385d9c41caf234e953cd0e.png)

You'll notice the total number of allowed meme posts is actually quite low and trending downward. There are many people mad at me every day for removing their hard-worked-on but not *that* funny memes. If you can deal with the frontpage usually having more memes than trading content (it always has), and just scroll down to the next page or two, there should almost always be the same old trading content you're used to.

Anyway, I hear ya, workin on it as always.",t3_m0pyf9,838

I wake up in my GameStop-branded bed and pull back the curtains to another beautiful day. The surface of the moon is sparkling with the glistening glow of fresh tendies that rained overnight.

I turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.

After finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.

As I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate ""GME21"", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.

Feeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination. 

After a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Jim Cramer takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.

I decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.

As I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.

That night, I bow to my framed photograph of /u/deepfuckingvalue before falling asleep, a soft smile on my face, optimistic and excited for what awaits me tomorrow.",t3_m0pyf9,29
