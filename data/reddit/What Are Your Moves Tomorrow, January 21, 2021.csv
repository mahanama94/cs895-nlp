Honestly speaking, I do not see a reason for the stock to go down, instead it should rally.

1.	⁠Revenues are supposed to cross $100 billion for the first time in the company’s history. That is a 12% yearly growth for the revenue. That should be a headline in itself.
2.	⁠Very strong demand for Iphone 12 and new Macs show a good outlook for the rest of the year.
3.	⁠Technically speaking, the stock is forming a cup and handle pattern which is bullish, its handle is almost formed and the breakout should come within a week, so it completely lines up with the earnings call. If it breaks the resistance, $150 isnt too far away.
4.	⁠Stocks generally rally whenever a new president takes office for around 100 days, the circumstances are different this time so might not be applicable here.
5. Apple car and smart glasses could be announced soon, or atleast some more rumors could come out that will boost investor interest. 

So for these reasons I think AAPL is a good idea before earnings.
