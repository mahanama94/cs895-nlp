Main requirement to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy, when retail collapsed during COVID they booted Macy's out very quickly.

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in the current climate.
