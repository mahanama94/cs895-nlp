Basically, if everyone is anticipating a terrible Q2 then it behooves responsible actors to pull back a bit before then to preserve tendies. The problem is if you expect others to pull out too, then it's best to pull back just before others for max tendies. But what if they're thinking the same thing? Waiting until the week of big earning is potentially disastrous if you're last. So do you start a week out, two weeks, a month, or keep a trigger finger ready to follow the first big boy to bail out?

This foward looking scenario will likely start in early June once current earnings are forgotten. The real paper hands won't happen until early July when Q2s start trickling in and real fear sets in.

SPY 250? No. But when the first big mover acts, the drop will be large and sudden.

Weird times indeed. 

Good luck to you",t1_frs3ifh,8
1590424438.0,2020-05-25,wallstreetbets,frs4sxq,"Ok bro. How bout this.

Step 1)  Get approved to sell Cash Covered Calls in your ira.

Pick $Spy, you will need $27,000 to do this trade

Step 2) The $270 strike put  december 18th , Put option is selling for $16.

So in order to do this trade , you need $27,000 cash and you need to be approved to sell a cash covered put.  

You are going to Sell to Open the december 18th , $270 Put for at least $16.

So these numbers are multiplied by 100, because contracts are done in 100 share increments.

Someone will pay you today $1600, for the right to sell $spy at $270.

$spy is currently trading at $293.  

Anything over $270.00 this put is worthless on december.  You keep the $1600.

So If $spy is under $270, you must buy 100 shares of $spy on december 18th.

How great of a deal is that.  You are getting paid, right now, today to make a promise to buy a stock 20 points below where it is now.

Its the s&p 500. Made up of 500 of the best stocks in the world.  Yes its over weighted by about 10 super companies. 

But still. 1600/27,000 = That's a guarantteed %5 return between now and december, mostly like you are going to keep the $1600.

Does this sound like a winner to you? Cause this is what the 1% is doing.  

They are not yoloing their entire account.

They are grinding out 10% a year with little risk.  They are contributing to their IRAs, they don't get car loans and have a big credit card balance.

I just helped you more than anyone actually ever helped me in my 40s.

I am 51.
