It is just money and it is replaceable. Maybe don’t over leverage yourself if you can’t take the hit. You are crazy enough to be here, so you’re crazy enough to make it back. Worst case, there’s bankruptcy. Debt wiped clean. Hell, my daddio was getting discover card offers only a few months into his bankruptcy. There is always hope.

Don’t make a permanent decision over a temporary situation.
