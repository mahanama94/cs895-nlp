“What are you looking at?” The question startles you. You stare at her like this most nights, and she never notices. But now she smiles at you—or rather her reflection in the mirror does—with an inquisitive eyebrow raised.

“Nothing much,” you try to joke, casually. But she turns around immediately, to look over her shoulder at you: “What’s wrong?” The gravity of her tone briefly catches you off guard, but you collect yourself: “What? Nothing’s wrong.” She stares at your face a bit longer, and then satisfied you aren’t lying—because she trusts you more than any human being she’s ever known—she turns back to her mirror and hair brushing.

And you know why tonight, of all nights, she noticed you watching her: she could sense your fear. She doesn’t know what SPY is. Or a call. But something primal in her knows what you did with those things, and how it is eating you alive inside. Because she loves you. 

Suddenly, you realize fully that you do not deserve the connection that allowed her to sense that in you, the connection that you lied in the face of. As her humming resumes, you start drafting your goodbye.",t3_ji04iv,37

Work in in construction/property management and watched them eliminate all of the competition over the last 20 years. .

They dominate the trash pickup business, promote themselves as ""Green technology"",  and they own their own landfills, They have the majority of all private property contracts plus municipal contracts everywhere. 

They charge by subscription,  not by volume of trash,
 so even though stadiums/large venues were closed, they still gotta pay the trash man.
