1608747162.0,2020-12-23,wallstreetbets,ggtgpbg,"Here is the deal with PLTR, and you can apply this to any tech related stock that isnt feeling the breakout.   


Traditional VC finance regarding tech is bullshit and hasn't caught up to truth that even though a company, like PLTR, isn't ""profitable"" (as in their balance sheet doesn't show a positive cashflow over expenses) then creditors and rating groups like ""shitron"" or ""credit suisee"" will always be bearish on it.  


Profitability is obviously very fucking important, but by the time you hop into a tech company that reported their first hard profitable quarter, the stock has already taken off. 

Amazon, Tesla, Apple = all these companies were in the the red FOR YEARS. Amazon had serious issues gaining traction getting VC funding because despite experiencing strong growth and a stronger pull to profitability VCs discounted it ""bECauSe iT wAsN't pRofiTaBle"" because they forgot that as a company invests in its infrastructure, they streamline and become more viable.

Look at what happened to Tesla, Every VC saw their product. Despite some production flaws, a Tesla vehicle has the highest consumer approval rating in the automotive industry. They had 1 profitable quarter and the price fucking flew from 189 share price to 645. 

Palantir has been around for a while, no argument about that. But the reason why they IPO'd so recently isn't a coincidence, they are becoming more and more profitable as quarters come by at a dramatic pace. This is especially true because they produce SOFTWARE. They have an insanely high market opportunity to grow into.
