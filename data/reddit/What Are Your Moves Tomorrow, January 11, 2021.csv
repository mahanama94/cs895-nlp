1) Q4 ER is starting and banks will set the mood going into Q4 earnings in general. In a low interest environment, even with the market run-up, profit is expected to be down. It's really if they can blow past expectations at this point and what management's guidance is. Just meeting expectation won't justify their company's valuation;

2) Biden doesn't seem like he'll have a honeymoon period with how polarized Congress is. While he wants to get a larger stimulus package out there, it depends on senators like Manchin, Murkowski, and Collins, who are as moderate as you can get;

3) Dec economic report wasn't that great. Manufacturing is expanding but the economy is pushing out both temp and long-term jobs. Important to note, however, that manufacturing is a leading economic indicator while payroll is a current indicator; and

Say, a 'WSB age' field, a comment activity field, and a submission activity field

Maybe something like Noob, 1-3 weeks, 1-6 months, 1-x years for the WSB age, then one of three emojis (ice, normal, fire) for activity.

So your user flair would be ""3 Years üî• üî•"" or something like that if you're both an active submitter and commenter. 

This would probably completely overwrite our current flairs or maybe allow extra text on the side. idk. Just an idea as to how we might address putting more eyes on the post history of people bringing information to our community.
