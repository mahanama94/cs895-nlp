Hold I will, and I encourage everyone who can afford it to do the same.

I’m newer to WSB (thank you vets for sharing your community), but based on the trade activity, volume, buy-sell ratios, and odd pricing (hitting ceilings, rapid spikes with gradual declines, etc) - I strongly believe this squeeze is still on the table. It’s obvious people are actually holding - I encourage you to do your own research. 

Don’t let this media narrative of “redditors abandon GME” spook you! That’s their goal - they want you to believe it, sell, then they get their self-fulfilling prophecy. DONT LET MEDIA NARRATIVES DICTATE YOUR BEHAVIOR! 

I’m not financial advisor, but with what I see, IM HOLDING 💎🤲

1612300456.0,2021-02-03,wallstreetbets,gls681h,"I doubled down on GME and AMC this morning. This is my take...

When this popped off in the media and shares rose to $300+, there were many including myself who said “damn, I wish I would’ve known about this sooner while it was cheaper to buy in!” at which point proceeded to buy at $336 a share. 

Well guess what, shares are cheaper now and it’s up to you to decide if it’s still early or if it’s over. I personally believe it’s just the beginning. You’ll never be that person that made life changing money if you just jump in while it’s the hot topic and bail as soon as shit gets real.

GMErs.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the easiest, most mentally menial tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital candle chart saying we did.

We'll punish ourselves doing by losing money, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time dreaming about making millions off this, and finally being able to talk to that cute girl who won’t reply...

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same posts over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know every little detail such that some have attained such GMEr nirvana that they can literally destroy these bots blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many monitors have been smashed, ape brains over heated, marriages and relationship destroyed in frustration? All to later be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our stonks? GMErs aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by bots and boomers with a shitty life. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with potential partners and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

GMErs are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another hedgie fight.

**“I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.”**

**“While the ‘value shorts’ that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,” Dusaniwsky added in an email.**

**The borrow fee on GameStop’s stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts and 50% on new short positions, S3 said.**

**“If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels — by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the ‘supposed’ buy-to-covers,” Dusaniwsky said.**

I trust the analytics guy that probably has access to Level 3 and says the squeeze hasn't happened. Also GME was put on the short sale restricted list Monday and lasts until tomorrow. There is 0 way this has happened already, SQUEEZE HAS NOT HAPPENED. THEYRE MAKING IT SEEM LIKE THE PLUMET FROM ROBINHOOD BEING SHUTDOWN WAS THE SQUEEZE.

1612350374.0,2021-02-03,wallstreetbets,glukt1s,"Hello.

I've been watching this WSB and saw lots of news about it. Finally decided to join in.

I have a solid day job as a nurse living in Finland and I've managed to push my expenses to quite minimal, so about 70% of the salary goes into savings, which I then invest if I see something worth it.

When I find some stock that I want, I then decide how much cash I want to use. Divide the sum in 3 parts, let's say I now have 10k which I would be about to spend on GME. I'll first buy 2000 eur worth of it. If it goes significantly lower, I'll buy with 5000 eur, and if it still goes lower, I'll use 3000 eur more. If it starts rocketing immediately, I might even stick with just that 2000 eur investment. All hits would be the so called Diamond Hands. Time delay between buys could be several days, or even a month, depending on situation.

The cash spent is just some savings that have no other purpose than to be used for increasing my balance. 

I've seen these troubling messages in WSB, where people put all-in at one go. They're quite alarming. I wish they would be more smart about it.

There's no Robinhood or equivalent in europe. The cost of transaction in my swedish bank is 18 dollars per buy/sell, so cheapest commission is when doing around 5000 dollar hits. Above that the commission changes so it takes percentage of the sale.

I'll be buying the GME soon, could be today, or even 2-3 weeks from now as mcuban suggested.

I'm already in AMC with 900 shares, median price 10$ per share and HOLDING forever.

Let's thrive together! All the best will happen to you guys, no matter what. Keep it cool.",t3_lb6aiq,35

1612301065.0,2021-02-03,wallstreetbets,gls7vy5,"So I decided that, with the rational side of my monkey brain, that actually it's very smart to hold now. Basically, Mark Cuban from today's AMA is right: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/comment/glqidn6?context=1

A ton of new shorters have jumped on this when RH & others have began limiting buys. Why wouldn't they? They saw a very obvious opportunity to take an obviously overvalued stock and make a killing shorting it as it correctly plummets.

Only problem is that a bunch of internet idiots, endless hordes of monkeys, have invested huge chunks of their money, some even their entire life savings, into this bet. And when that happens, what ends up happening is they don't take the loss, they DOUBLE DOWN. I know I fucking will.

And so Cuban said people will buy when they get a chance, and I think we will, because otherwise we admit defeat. No way are a bunch of people with nothing to lose and a cause to believe in gonna take rational stock of a situation like this and just take the massive losses.

And now we have a ton of new shorting, smart assholes betting against us, and that just means THEY will have to cover their ass. So we're goin to the moon, monkeys, HOLD!!

And this phenomenon will take us there:

We’ve talked a lot about this over the past 48 hours in my house, and as hard as it will be to swallow if this really is the end and the stock doesn’t recover, I’d be more upset with myself for not trying (especially if this does recover)! I’m not an investor, I don’t know what I’m doing, I grew up poor and we’ve never really gotten ahead financially.  My wife and I are both in university while in our 30s, $5k is a lot for us, but we jumped on this potential opportunity, and at the very least we’re part of a group of people taking a stand against corruption - I’m willing to take a shot, and so are you buddy!
