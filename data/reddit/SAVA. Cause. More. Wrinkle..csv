1633106292.0,2021-09-11,wallstreetbets,hezqy5n,"Still waiting to hear back from the family member. I can confirm she is no longer working in this field directly and has since switched labs to a focus on CRISPR tech. I am confident that if she is aware of the medication she will be able to give me some info though. I cannot prove that I know this person because I would be doxing myself. 

What I'm seeing is that the previous allegations appear to be completely bullshit. The results of the 12 month trial were sent out to two independent biostatisticians who both verified the data and came to the same conclusions separately.

Further, the FDA doesn't seem to have paid any attention to the lawyers petition, and the fact that the whistleblowers took out a short position before the petition was brought forward just screams of manipulation. Far as I'm concerned they can whistle blow on my dick until there is some actual evidence brought forward. Seeing as the 12 month data has come after that and has been independently verified by Ph.D statisticians, I see no reason to believe that the medication isn't legitimate. 

Fingers crossed for good phase 3 trial results. I'm in for now and will add more if I get any good news back.

Edit: For anyone waiting on me, my contact simply mentioned that she is skeptical of the mechanism of action and said there is very little research supporting the idea. However, isn't that true of all new treatments? We don't know until the trials are completed. Take that for what you will. Not financial advice.",t3_pz6w8h,32

What value would Simufilam have. Starting with the $350 billion say they can reduce that cost by 10% $35 billion. This is already about 17x the present market cap giving a non-multiple SP of $873. I would place the multiplier at 4-10 due to repeat and growing annual market conservatively. So minimum $3500 per share.

Or it's just a pain company's wild stab at another disease. There hasn't been a Phase III compound in the last 20 years with less known about it than Simufilam. Search for any approved or p3 drug and see how many external papers there are. With Simufilam and the filamin A hypothesis it's just Wang and Burns for years and years, and one weird tubular sclerosis paper. There are over 20,000 AD papers a year, probably over 100k AD researchers, but just 2 of them are going down this road.

In summary, the biomarkers were blinded and included a placebo arm.  Placebo biomarkers are not treated, so their baselines should not change.

The second lab's data was consistent with what one would expect in the placebo arm.  That's an entirely reasonable explanation.  

Second, that data is not in isolation.  If you correlate with ADAS cog, NPI, and spatial test, and paired test scores, guess what, they correlate. That is why Remi keeps repeatedly saying that the data is consistent across three trials and multiple measures.

I agree. That part is more speculative and less ""hard evidence."" With that said, I directly communicated with Elisabeth and, unfortunately, lost much respect for her and her work. Before my dealings with her, I became anxious that she had ""concerns"" over SAVA's data. That changed quickly after interacting with her.  
Long story short, I was not too fond of her tone on Twitter. She was wildly presumptuous and biased. Dr. Wang was undoubtedly guilty until proven innocent from her POV. (she has deleted several tweets since then). I mean, she crucified him on social media, but what shook me the most was, she did not bother looking up the data on clinicaltrials.gov or research gate. If you look through her blog, I left several comments, and I was quite agitated. Those comments were real-time issues. She later modified her blog to reflect data. If you want to get super technical, please look up the comments by SAVAage on research gate. There is a clear explanation of why the N varied between different secondary endpoints of P2 trials (the spatial and paired test). Dr. Burn has also responded to some of the questions.   
Less concerning, but still bothersome, there was no attempt at directly contacting Dr. Wang. I found several other issues, including her refusal to accept accepted protocol, as a valid explanation (Im alluding to removing outliers). The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.   
All that to say, that I do agree with ad-science with questioning her motives. (Disclaimer, I am not the author of any section of ad-science.) I have concluded that her posts on social media are indeed biased, and her motive is notoriety. Without the notoriety, she will not get donations via Patreon. She lives off her Patreon donations now that she is not in microbiology-ing.   
Objectively and hard evidence-wise, the last time I ran westerns were 22+ years ago in high school AP biology, so I am not an expert there. Ad-sciences explanations made sense to me. They had several potential explanations, which you reviewed. What did you think of those?  
Im not sure if you are a clinician, but if you are, this will resonate with you the most in deciding on increasing or decreasing your position. IMO, 99% of allegations are preclinical-research-related. I have extensively written on the difference between preclinical and clinical data. Why is preclinical data irrelevant when it contradicts clinical data? Check out my posts, and I will include a discussion on that in the google doc.   
We have also discussed this on the discord; let me know if you would like to join.  I will DM you the link.",t1_hf89nqw,4
1633105166.0,2021-09-11,wallstreetbets,hezoapi,"That was a hypothetical if—a very big if.  SAVA itself asked that Dr. Wang be investigated.  No one here is okay with Dr. Wang fabricating data, and the fact is the odds of him manufacturing data are almost zero. Allegations will be investigated by CUNY School of Medicine, and Sava has asked for nothing less.

If you are interested in reading about the allegations and rebuttal, please review the CP and the negation at www.ad-science.org.  

I wouldn't accuse a tenured professor with an excellent reputation without solid evidence.  

So my point is, even if there is a fraud (which there probably isn't), do you take the data collected at 16 independent sites and validated by independent P.hDs and throw it out the window?  What about the 6 million AD patients?  I'd suggest we do further testing.

1633108819.0,2021-09-11,wallstreetbets,hezwuz6,"They raised a ton of issues. I'm a not an expert, but here's my best effort at interpreting/summarizing a few of them: 

No other lab has confirmed Cassava's research connecting Filamin A to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), nor has any other lab confirmed that Simufilam binds or modifies Filamin A or has effects in AD models. There is trace amounts of Filamin A in the brain and no evidence of misfolding Filamin A, as SAVA claims. If you Google ""Filamin A Alzheimer's"" you'll notice all of the results are from Cassava (Dr. Wang & Burns) or pointing to their research. 

Cassava moved their ADAS-COG baseline over time. In Feb 2021, the mean baseline was 15.5 (6-month results). In July 2021, the new baseline was 16.6 (9-month results). SAVA didn't bother reporting the mean baseline during the September update (12-month results). So, while SAVA shows a +320bps improvement vs. baseline, one-third of that benefit comes solely from moving the baseline. 

Another issue is measuring improvement in AD patients. It is notoriously difficult. Think about it, AD is a slow deterioration of the mind, so its very difficult to measure over months. SAVA is not using a placebo, so there is no reference point -- every patient is aware they are getting a drug, so they are more inclined to say that they feel better. The standard deviation is large (+/- 6.3), which means the ADAS-COG11 could very well be deteriorating.  

Difficult to share here without photos, but obviously you have the main CP issues: falsifying Western Blots, using same brains for 15 years, and all data controlled by Dr. Wang & Burns.

All I'm saying is you should ask her to give the data an objective look. The closer you look, the stranger things get...",t1_hezdjnh,0

1633111205.0,2021-09-11,wallstreetbets,hf02csf,"Well you can go back to those ivy league snobs and tell them to do a pubmed search and they will see these findings have been studied and described in other papers, by unaffiliated scientist.  We can also debate the mechanism of action, but those smart IVY league doctors should understand the limitations of bench research.  They should also understand which takes priority when there is a contradiction; clinical findings (cognition Improvement) or a theory about filamin. Spoiler oh, they will tell you that cognitive Improvement trump's all.

So if there are trace amounts of filamin (I wont go into how incorrect that statement is) but a medication for filamin is working, then real scientists don't conclude the data is manipulated. What they do is take both pieces of information and expand on it, and try to understand what they are missing.  That's called progress.  Ask those ivy league doctors how lithium works, when they tell you doctors don't know, then tell them, ""how can you use it if you don't know how it works?"" Then they will tell you,"" if it works clinically, it works.""

If you actually read my post and reviewed the data analysis by the neurologist, you wouldn't be asking about the standard deviation.  It's easily explained.  I refer you to the link.

Every researcher knows that all trials have patients who drop out, when they drop out they take their Baseline with them. The aftermath of the patient dropping out is the Baseline changing.  If you want to review www.ad- science.org, they explain why increasing Baseline scores hurt Sava's clinical results. 

I refuse to believe that ivy league doctors told you Alzheimer's patients don't decline over 12 months. Sava compared their open-label data to expected decline from a cohort of 20,000 AD patients. Also you can argue about cognition scores varying, but that effect is over days to weeks not over 12 months. Also, the actual cognitive test that was used is considered the gold standard by the FDA. If you have a better test to let me know.

I try to stay civil in my replies, but I don't like being called a fake doctor.  Also you're just recycling post from fud all over Twitter.  

My explanations can get as complex as you'd like, I can go deep into the science but the simple answer is clinical results show cognitive Improvement, then the FDA does not care about how much filamin is in the brain.  They care about demented Alzheimer's patients getting better.  If that has to do with it a specific protein great if it doesn't, who cares.",t1_hezwuz6,5
