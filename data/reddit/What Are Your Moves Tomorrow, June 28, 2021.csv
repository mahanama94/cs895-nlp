1624839275.0,2021-06-28,wallstreetbets,h39n9mv,"SPCE is very unlikely to catch up to their valuation with Space Tourism.  A niche service, likely to only be enjoyed once or twice, offered to a high-end customer is rarely going to be a money making operation.

The only avenue I see for them is to figure out Exo-atmospheric Terrestrial travel.  Leaving the atmosphere can make for some insanely fast travel ( As we see with the ISS and ICBMs that can travel faster than 15000 mph ).  Being able to fly from DC to Japan in the time it takes to fly from DC to Vegas ( or less ) would be incredibly appealing to wealthy, business class, and everyday vacationers alike, which would ( should ) allow them to push costs down to an acceptable level.

I don't know if this is their ultimate plan ( if it isn't, I have no idea how they intend to actually make money ), but that still seems like a ways out and there's some first-mover risk of dumping a lot of capital to figure out all the gotchas, only to later allow latecomers to benefit from your efforts and surpass you with healthier balance sheets.

I'm neutral on SPCE and have no dog in the race for now, but just wanted to point out that space tourism isn't likely to be the cash cow you might think.  Proceed with caution, but best of luck!",t1_h39km71,7
