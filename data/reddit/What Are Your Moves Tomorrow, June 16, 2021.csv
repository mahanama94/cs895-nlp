Pre-Market until 12:30pm is going to be a fucking bloodbath with only corn and corn related stocks green. Energy stocks will be barely staying green bouncing from +0.5 to +1% making them an unappealing safe haven because the whole market looks like it‚Äôs going down. From 1pm until Romey Rome gets on the mic the market will trade sideways as people are figuring out how much they can sell their kids for. CNBC from the moment you wake up will be like watching the original Saw while you are having a bad trip in an abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods on a full moon. Terrifying. Burry will send out some absolutely horrific charts and historical data that everyone takes as gospel. 3pm hits and Jpow gives us that nod and cute wink that it‚Äôs all good and to close our buttholes bc it‚Äôs not time. Remainder of power hour until AH is complete is green as fuck. Spy closes at 428 and ends the week just above 430.

But in case he mentions anything about planning to taper, don't just rush in to buy puts or short the market. Some of it or all of it might already be priced in - or maybe not. Nobody can tell for sure. So remain calm and check the action in the 10Y bond yield and EURUSD.

Expectedly, any significant announcement about taper should mean

1) Bullish Dollar
2) Bearish TLT

Meaning: yields should shoot up at significantly pace higher and dollar $DXY should start rallying. If DXY starts rallying, EURUSD would dip.

All of the above is bearish for stocks. All sorts of stocks. This will give a signal of what's to come. So check that first, before making any move. Mentioning this because I plan to do the same.

On the flip side, if there is little to no reaction in yields, DXY or EURUSD, but the stock market moves violently, think of it as noise. Chances are stocks will continue to go higher.

All being said, still don't expect Fed to mention anything different on tapering.",t3_o0n6ry,20
