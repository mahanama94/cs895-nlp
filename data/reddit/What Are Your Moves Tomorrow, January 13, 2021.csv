[https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE](https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE) 

ICLN had a 'golden cross' moment (my first green arrow from left to right: 7EMA passing 100EMA). As soon as this occurred, there was an influx in volume (400K volume) spike, mostly options driven. Of those options, 73% were bulls (calls) and 27% were bears (puts). Majority lead, bulls. The average price target on options was at a $1.98 above it's current trading value which is $32.34, which puts the majority of the bullish call options around a \~$34 call. As a result, the relative strength index (bottom green arrow) has been tapering around 65%. This indicates potential further upwards momentum. And for those who didn't read this... here are some rockets.  🚀🚀🚀  TLDR: $ICLN Call options in April/July at $34C will print, anticipate the ticker to hit a $34C by Friday post-Biden announcement.
