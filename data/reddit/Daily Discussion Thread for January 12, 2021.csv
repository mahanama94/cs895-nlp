-Equity market has been broadening out, but bull market has resumed. This is not like the tech and telecom bubble where the market narrowed towards internet companies, the broadening out of the market is healthy.

-Expects earnings to explode this year.

-Genetics and bio will continue to get fast tracked under current circumstances. Biden's son had cancer so this could be a soft spot for the next administration and could lead to more investment in this field.

-Clean energy will receive bipartisan support going forward. Technology has evolved enough in the cost curve that clean energy will no longer need subsidies but might still get them anyways, which is a bonus.

-Biden administration might tax foreign earning on the big companies which could benefit smaller caps that are only in the US.

-Interest rates going up might cause a correction but it shows that the market is resolving itself and will recover.",t3_kvpl3x,14

[https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE](https://imgur.com/a/NrC5JJE) 

ICLN had a 'golden cross' moment (my first green arrow from left to right: 7EMA passing 100EMA). As soon as this occurred, there was an influx in volume (400K volume) spike, mostly options driven. Of those options, 73% were bulls (calls) and 27% were bears (puts). Majority lead, bulls. The average price target on options was at a $1.98 above it's current trading value which is $32.34, which puts the majority of the bullish call options around a \~$34 call. As a result, the relative strength index (bottom green arrow) has been tapering around 65%. This indicates potential further upwards momentum. And for those who didn't read this... here are some rockets.  🚀🚀🚀  TLDR: $ICLN Call options in April/July at $34C will print, anticipate the ticker to hit a $34C by Friday post-Biden announcement.
