* **A charistmatic leader**

Bear gang general, bear jesus

* **Brainwashing**

Economy is shit, trade deal about to collapse, Brexit, Hong Kong, Yuan peg, 0.6% chance of NO rate cut

* **Economic, sexual, and other exploitation of group members**

Many bears have been anally raped, financially

* **The group/leader is always right**

Market is wrong

* **The group is preoccupied with making money and/or bringing in new members**
