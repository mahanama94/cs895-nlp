From what I’ve looked into the demand for uranium is only going up and in recent years uranium has supplied 90% of the requirements for power utilities. If you look at uranium prices pre Fukushima there is a large gap that is being filled by clean energy demands. The projected growth for the price per pound of uranium is approx 26% for years 2020-2030. However, with the increase of electricity demands rising and worries about carbon emissions, the demand for uranium powered energy can only rise. Hence, DNN (uranium mine in Canada) appears to be a solid bet for growth this year especially with the expected price rebound for uranium in 2021.
