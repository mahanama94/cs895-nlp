It’s been that way for the past four months where the correlation between the S&P 500 and the Fed’s balance sheet has expanded to a 95% relationship. This is a case of a very accommodative Fed policy. The double-digit growth in the money supply is bypassing the real economy and has entered into asset markets broadly, and specifically into equities. So as long as the Fed is in the game priming the monetary pump, shorting stocks is going to be a very dangerous game to play….

The power of the Fed has become so acute that it has replaced the economy as a principle influence over the stock market to the point where there is only a 7% correlation between GDP and the S&P 500. Historically, in any given cycle that relationship was anywhere between 30% and 70%.” -“David Rosenberg Warns “We’re Going To Have Helicopter Money”, Zero Hedge.

AAA bonds getting downgraded to BBB, and BBB to junk. Crowding out effect means infinite QE will cause housing crisis at the same time as credit crisis and unemployment crisis.

If you think stimulus package can offset this, I got a bridge to sell you. 

Market is so far removed from reality, 0% interest rates mean no brakes on car, infinite QE means crowding out effect is going to crush avg Joe. Now consider 45 days likely to change into 4 months and then fall Covid hits.

So many hilariously obvious warning bells going off, and everyone is just like, 10m jobless... pffft, we got a stimulus package!

Like people don't even understand that the liquidity solution walks us right into a solvency crisis.

All this is doing is pushing the eventual floor lower. US senators were selling all their stocks ahead of the actual fall, but its DEFINITELY not happening now. No way they would do that to us, they care about us.
