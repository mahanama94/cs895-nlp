It’ll probably have a minor correction and I’ll buy back in when the options become cheap again.  Also for everyone looking at yesterday’s earnings going wtf, they basically said it was a one time thing due to the Texas winter storm and that’s why they beat it so heavily",t3_n75uz5,7

In the interest of brevity, look at trades in options today expiring 2023 at the 4 and 5 strike. That is a ton of new positions. They were selling with zero time value, meaning you get ET for essentially half off. On sale. Put/call ratio .04 for the day. I own the units and ITM calls for 2023 and added today. I started buying more after KMI reported. Shortages in everything, most of which cant get better without oil and gas.",t3_n75uz5,4

With the ability to create more pipelines now basically non existant, the value of current ones will continue to increase, especially those involved in nat gas.",t3_n75uz5,3
1620445481.0,2020-02-02,wallstreetbets,gxcpegp,"I keep hearing the same tired line, as I've been shouting from the rooftops for people to get on ET and oil. 

""Oil has had a run im waiting for the pullback.""

Yes, oil has had a run and ET just smashed it, but this is oil season baby. Unlike overvalued tech etc, oil was destroyed by the pandemic and has not recovered. I.E. oil has more room to run than other sectors. 

It is baffling that people would try and time the market when its literally one of the oldest cliches that you dont try and time the market. 

Tldr: oil is gonna keep running and you're a fool if you're waiting to time it.",t3_n75uz5,3

1620446424.0,2020-02-02,wallstreetbets,gxcqv13,"Also, as a soon-to-be-graduated law student who just took a course on remedies (injunctions), i strongly believe ET has the stronger legal case against an injunction. An injunction is meant to preserve the status quo. The line is already built, and oil is already flowing. Thus, preserving the status quo would be to keep the line open. 

Additionally, to get an injunction there must be the threat of immediate and irreparable harm. Not the mere possibility, but actual imminent threat. The tribe's argument is ""maybe possibly the line might break which might harm our water supply."" I dont think this cuts it. 

Another element is the balance of hardships. Leaving the line open is really no hardship on the tribes. Saying ""maybe possibly it might break"" is not a hardship. On the other hand, pro pipeline tribes, the entire Bakken Shale region, several states, and numerous companies stand to lose billions of dollars by a shutdown.  

The only way this injunction gets granted is through straight up judicial activism. If the judge says no injunction, this baby is primed for an even bigger liftoff.

1620599180.0,2020-02-02,wallstreetbets,gxjmrzt,"One thing I saw when I got into it was low interest on certain expiry options because the price was too close to earlier dated calls. Tried to open 40 calendars 5/7 -5/21 at 8, 8.5, and 9. Was only able to get 10 of the 8 strike to fulfill on 4/28. Now I made a bit of money and picked up some shares Friday for dividends, but the action was a little slow to get into the position strong.

 Looking to get a little more skin in the game tomorrow, but will save most of my powder for dip on dividend payout.

Currently 100 shares, Looking at 10c at several expirations and may open some slightly OTM calendars to get more long exposure (warning; made it cheap to enter, but I had to buy back my 5/7 short legs after getting assigned on one)",t3_n75uz5,1
1620804714.0,2020-02-02,wallstreetbets,gxtumug,"I have been bullish on Pipeline operators since January. The White House decision to halt the keystone pipeline was a non event that most of the Medias reported as the end of the oil industry.

personally, the declaration of Kerry ""let them build solar panels"" reminded me of the attributed quote to Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, ""Let them eat cake""

We should not forget that 7 out of the 50 dem senators are actually coming from Oil & gas states. Dems cannot afford to lose majority and to affect the economies of these states. Dems in the House performed already badly in the last elections, they spent millions in House seats campaign without winning a seat. Evidently the keystone stop was the only thing biden could do to please the Green part of the Dems

Biden 2020 kind of reminds Obama 2008. Obama in 2008 could not push extensively for green policies because Congress support was thin (and he had 60 senators at the time!). today consensus on green policies is stronger, but dem majority is weaker

Lastly, we should not forget that most of the developing world relies on biomass and coal for energy generation, that will be substituted by propane (natural gas liquids) and eventually natural gas too
