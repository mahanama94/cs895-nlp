RKT is making a bit of a killing by buying back loans of people who opted to skip payments with new covid rules. 

They look to see which loans are likely go back to current (low loan to value and good credit) but the skipped payments triggers a rule that lets the servicer rebuy at par (these loans trade well above par). They then cure the loans, repackage them into MPTs and sell them well above par back to the buy side and Fed. The Fed buys 40Billion a month and that helps ensure an well above par bid.

RKT and WFC have been super agressive with this but RKT is the pure play. Many of these loans are still curing on RKT's balance sheet but once they cure they can be re-sold and the profits will go straight to the bottom line. Spring loaded high margin earnings just loaded up on the balance sheet waiting to be realized.

It is a free money clitch caused by the Covid rules and they are making huge profits.",t3_oag1qt,12

> Day Cozcacuauhtli (Vulture, known as Cib in Maya) is governed by Itzpapalotl as its provider of tonalli (Shadow Soul) life energy. Cozcacuauhtli signifies long life, wisdom, good counsel and mental equilibrium. It is a good day to confront the discontinuities, disruptions, failures and deaths one suffers in life. Cozcacuauhtli is a day for tricking the Trickster.

> The thirteen day period (trecena) that starts with day 1-Cuetzpalin (Lizard) is ruled by Itzlacoliuhqui. **The 13 days of this trecena are governed by the meting out of irrational rewards and punishments. These are 13 days of confusion, a time when the noble and ignoble have equal chance to be raised up or thrown down.** The warrior must be like the lizard, who is not hurt from a high fall but, instead, immediately climbs back to its perch. These are good days to keep out of sight; bad days to attract attention.
