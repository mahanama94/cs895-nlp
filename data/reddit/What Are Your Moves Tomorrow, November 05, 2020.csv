Biden + red senate means : 1) dramatically reduced trade tensions and a rollback of trump's protectionist policies, and 2) biden can no longer pass sweeping tax reform to raise corporate taxes. 

Biden winning means any chance of stimulus wouldn't come until after inauguration, and a few weeks after that.  That means Feb/march. But the fact that the senate is red means much more delays.  With pfizer and moderna reporting vaccine data in Nov, and no negotiations for stimulus until at least Feb, the red Senate might just say no stimulus at all in Feb/March because it'll be almost spring by then, and there may be more than once vaccine for at least EUA. 


No, the market is pumping because wall street wins based on reduced trade tension, and wall street wins when corporations have bigger profits since they're de-risked for tax increases. 

Stimi isn't what's pumping based in this split govt. Much bigger effects wrt corporate taxes and trade. This is probably the best scenario out of all.",t3_jo3vqg,16

Might as well take crazy risks or it’s unlikely you’ll get what you really want out of life. Sad to see how all the laws/rules/regulations of the “civilized” world has led to people being afraid to take any risk in life, while simultaneously blinding them to the possibilities that are always there but seem unrealistic due to others rules/opinions.
