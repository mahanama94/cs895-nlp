Now, there is nothing wrong with government deciding on and implementing policy to shape its society in a given way, and there is nothing wrong with government incentivizing the public to go along with it; that is indeed the nature and essence of government, and every government has the right to do this, including the CCP. We have heard they wish to curb monopoly power among the tech sector; to make education more broadly available to meet public demand by nationalizing those services; and now, it appears, they wish to curb the influence of gaming among the Chinese populace. All well and good.

The problem here, however, is that the CCP does not do this in a measured, deliberate, transparent, and predictable way; it instead acts whimsically and capriciously, without warning and without any attempt to gradually telegraph its plans to the investing public so that the market has time to react in a more measured fashion. This stands in stark contradistinction to the deliberative, telegraphed, and gradual process that marks US and European lawmaking and regulation, where statutes like the US' Administrative Procedures Act (APA) mandate public comment and interactive dialogue in regulated industries. The CCP's willingness to act in such a way is deliberate: the party moves swiftly and without warning not only to implement its goals as expeditiously as possible, but also to remind people--and especially foreign and US investors--who is in charge. Lack of reciprocity thoroughly characterizes the Chinese/Rest-of-the-World relationship, and this business with the edu companies here and the gaming stocks today serve as yet more examples of that lack of reciprocity; other governments do not treat Chinese investors like China treats its foreign investors.

This is the problem and the outsized regulatory risk that's laid bare once again by the CCP acting this way towards the edu companies.

And, yes, the fundamentals are good, great even. But these names are cheap for a reason. Just be aware of and factor in the CCP risk when going long.",t3_oxhnsr,17

What do you think? I don't think evidence for the real estate thesis is strong here.

also for the real estate value to be realized there must be a positive catalyst. I come from experience of investing in deep value tickers in Singapore like Haw Par Corp (makers of the famous Tiger Balm) and Bukit Sembawang (a real estate developer and one of the OGs in Singapore).

Anyway--

You're right, nationalization wouldn't surprise me either given the purpose of this new regulation was to improve education accessibility and birth rate. I think the most likely outcome is spin off the tutoring biz into a nonprofit (which is the new mandate). And whatever is left either continues trading (great), delists and trades OTC (also great--see LK/LKNCY), any type of M&A (great because it most certainly will be above -$600m EV), or it gets nationalized (which is technically also one type of M&A).

If it does get nationalized, the HK listed stock will get bought out, and most definitely above -$600m. Sure there is a chance the Chinese gvt lowballs the bid, but that's why I like this trade because there's a massive cushion since it's at negative EV. In addition, keep in mind 87% of the cap table is institutional, and majority of it is blue chip US institutions like BLK. It's unlikely they get completely low-balled by the CCP in the case of nationalization due to poor optics, for the same reason the CCP has (for once) admitted its ignorance on the market implications of such a regulation.

In any case, I don't want to speculate on what the CCP will do next. This helped for scenario building and probabilities for risk adjusted returns but ultimately to me it's just a simple value trade that such a liquid name is clearly undervalued at negative -$600m EV. Rest is cherry on top and I won't venture to speculate on how much this can run.",t1_h7mr8e0,3

25% of EDU is still perfectly legal (foreign language, bookstores, admissions consulting, school tours etc.). The CCP even made a very rare move admitting their mistake in not considering the market implications of such a move. That means there's a chance it goes back. Korea is a perfect analogy, this happened to Korean for-profit tutoring in 1970, and it became a politicized issue and look at Korean tutoring now, it's even more intense than in China.

1628162790.0,2021-02-07,wallstreetbets,h7sk26w,"100% agree. If you look at buying US at these prices vs. China its kind of a no brainer, you are taking risk either way. At least with China stocks a lot of price risk has been taken off the table. They had a litteral crash, comparable to any other crash on the board and now you can grab them at the bottom. Its not passing these stocks on to my grandkids in 40 years or anything, its just a swing trade",t1_h7ou5b6,0

Edit: while I know there is a slight premium in $EDU you are paying more for holding HK listing. It's also far less liquid. So, given fungibility, it's a simple matter of transferring shares by calling your broker. I personally don't see the risk in EDU vs HK while I see a far better position being in EDU if things start to recover.",t1_ha5sthz,1

Sure you’ll have liquidation tx expenses but that’ll run in the low millions. The consideration here is $4b of NET cash. It’s hardly material to the valuation",t1_h7n58z3,5
