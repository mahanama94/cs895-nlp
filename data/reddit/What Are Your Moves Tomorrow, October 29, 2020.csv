1603933393.0,2020-10-29,wallstreetbets,gag0wmq,"GEX went negative today, this trend was pretty much an inevitability since it spiked at an ATH on Oct 13. The only times this year that GEX dropped below zero were back in September on the 17th and 21st, and before that starting on February 24th for the Covid drop which lasted the entire month of March. 

I've been trying to follow the dark pool metrics as close as I can to try to predict general overall trends in the market and my best guess was for today's drop to happen tomorrow given the perfect storm of current events and all the big tech earnings happening all at once. Seems that all the new Covid news kickstarted this a day sooner.

Best guess from an amateur is that we might see an opportunity to close positions tomorrow as people try to make a fast buck on tech calls but with GEX, DIX, and VIX all pointing to bearish trends I can't see things turning around until we know the outcome of the election.

When Mango tanked the market by 300 points in a day with a single tweet I started prepping for this day by liquidating short term positions and buying VXX/UVXY stock and calls (cause they were super cheap then), and then yolo'd QQQ and SPY puts that paid off like a lottery tickets today. I closed all contracts and I plan on keeping the VXX/UVXY stock through the weekend into the election. If you're holding any VIX ETFs keep a close eye on them as they're easy come easy go, once the market wants to bounce back they'll crater so lock in those profits at your discretion.

Again best guess is we see green tomorrow that probably bleeds to close and then another dump into Friday, GEX still has a ways to unwind in my opinion and VIX is primed for another jump. Then if the election is a contested shit show like everyone is predicting there should be more volatility to wade through next week. I'm not touching calls until election results are announced, and then we should be in a full on Hulk dick bonanza in the short term following if history serves as a precedent.

Godspeed retards, don't fight the trend. Let it work for you, it's just as easy to make money on the way down as it is going up.",t3_jjva2o,29

because i realize now that too much diversification is insanity and that wealth comes more from concentration.

the only reason why i diversified in the first place was to take advantage of market imbalances, but as it turns out, market imbalances don’t really happen—if the SP500 is shit, more than likely everything else is shit too. so it’s better to concentrate your portfolios because you’d get more returns, instead of diversifying your losses.
