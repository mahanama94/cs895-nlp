Stimulus? If it passes, great more money for me! If it doesn't? I'm their best bet to get rich quick!

Vaccine? If it's coming, great! People can go to work and make money to feed me. It isn't? Well I guess people are holed up watching sports -- may as well bet on that, yeah?

Titans/Vikings games may need to be postponed? Rub some dirt on it, plus there are 14 other games to bet on.

There's no bad news for DKNG unless the NFL season gets cancelled.",t3_j35to3,9
