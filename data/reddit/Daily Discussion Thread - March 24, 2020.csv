There is then the rally when everyone thinks we have to have priced in this risk, those in power are going to handle this thing and everything will return to normal. This is the culmination of the ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù wisdom and is like air rushing in after the nuclear bomb detonates. 

What everyone who wasn‚Äôt a part of ‚Äò08 or have recently come to WSB from r/all needs to understand is that bear markets have a third phase, one which destroys everyone equally- the long, drawn out bleeding. This part lasts the longest and makes everyone miserable. Bulls because the dip becomes the chasm becomes the crack to the core. Bears because volatility dies down as the lifeless corpse stops twitching as violently. This is when people decide that the rally will never come again. News anchors will start talking about ‚Äúfundamental shifts in how the market is being valued.‚Äù This is radiation from the blast, come to slowly drain the life from everything it touches. 

TL;DR: bears, wait a day or two and when the rally starts fading, buy longer and lower dated puts. Bulls, enjoy your last glimpses of the sun before nuclear winter sets in.",t3_fo3bjb,81
