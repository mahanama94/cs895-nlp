/r/investing : I bought TSLA at $300 and I will be holding 50 years. Rest of my money is in VOO.

Kids: Wow, granddad is really losing it. 

Me: Did you know you used to have to drive your car by yourself? It's true! We used to listen to the radio every morning to make sure no one died on our way to work so we wouldn't be late. 

Kids: That's just stories, granddad.
