Toss in the already anti Chinese sentiments brewing due to the lab leak theory and you have a fairly clear pivot away from China (I.e. they fucked the global economy for an entire year).

Steel is used by construction firms and large manufacturers. It’s not an everyday product for Americans like gas. 

The price of steel can increase and get passed onto those that are using it for a year or two with nobody getting too worked up about it. 

Beyond that, America has long since needed to be rid of Chinese steel. Momentary growing pains while American manufactures scale/increase capacity is completely acceptable IMO. 

Even in the construction of homes, lumber is the defining price and not steel 9 times out of 10. Steel is a commercial product, the commercial sector can pass on those costs for those that NEED to build right now.",t1_h246kqw,1
