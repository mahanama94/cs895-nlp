1624515684.0,2021-06-24,wallstreetbets,h2uwpw7,"I'm way too tired but I can't sleep. I peeked at the Krispy Kreme IPO

[Their debt](https://i.imgur.com/zpFZoT5.png) is so severe it eats exactly all of their profit 💀

Their [shareholder equity](https://i.imgur.com/wp2xxc2.png) is about $700m, but they have $1b **goodwill** and $1b **intangible assets** ☠️💀

In accountant speak goodwill is a non-tangible, retained value asset that cannot have a hard value placed on it because it's a theoretical value, like brand recognition or if you acquired another business for a premium over book value.

This means the actual book value of Krispy Kreme is anywhere between -$1.2b and +$700m 🥴

I would further pick apart the goodwill and intangibles to see why they could justify it and their auditors approved it, but I'm very tired and I've seen enough to know there's no way I'm touching this.

Krispy Kreme is IPO-ing to keep their lights on. Maybe the initial dilution and further dilutions will allow them to start bringing in some pennies every quarter, but to pay off that $1b interest-bearing deadweight debt $5 million/qtr at a time will take 50 years.

Then get confused and close out your original positions but hold everything else. Then get greedy and keep changing your stop limits. Look away from your trading app for five minutes and come back to see your option price blew past your stop loss limit and didn’t trigger. Panic sell your losing option and buy into the opposite security to try and capture some of the momentum. Fat finger purchase 14 contracts instead of 1. Lose $1,000 instantly as the original position you sold reverses and rallies to all time highs. Diamond hands until zero.
