1624515684.0,2021-06-24,wallstreetbets,h2uwpw7,"I'm way too tired but I can't sleep. I peeked at the Krispy Kreme IPO

[Their debt](https://i.imgur.com/zpFZoT5.png) is so severe it eats exactly all of their profit üíÄ

Their [shareholder equity](https://i.imgur.com/wp2xxc2.png) is about $700m, but they have $1b **goodwill** and $1b **intangible assets** ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

In accountant speak goodwill is a non-tangible, retained value asset that cannot have a hard value placed on it because it's a theoretical value, like brand recognition or if you acquired another business for a premium over book value.

This means the actual book value of Krispy Kreme is anywhere between -$1.2b and +$700m ü•¥

I would further pick apart the goodwill and intangibles to see why they could justify it and their auditors approved it, but I'm very tired and I've seen enough to know there's no way I'm touching this.

Krispy Kreme is IPO-ing to keep their lights on. Maybe the initial dilution and further dilutions will allow them to start bringing in some pennies every quarter, but to pay off that $1b interest-bearing deadweight debt $5 million/qtr at a time will take 50 years.
