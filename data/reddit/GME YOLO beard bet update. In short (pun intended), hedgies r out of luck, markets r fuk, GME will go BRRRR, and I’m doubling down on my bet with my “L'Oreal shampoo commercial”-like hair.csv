Wo even long term holders pre squeeze are still looking at about 10x profit(on shares alone!) 

A “squeeze” wont be triggered every again since the cat got out of the bag on gamestop and now the awareness of shorting as grown too much for firms to play that same trick. Can there be a massive run up AND pop? Yeah but we need sp500 inclusion or dividends brought back. For that
