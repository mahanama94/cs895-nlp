AMC on 1/1/2020 (ie pre-covid): 

Enterprise value: $10.8 billion
Market cap: $700 million
Net debt: $10.1 billion
NTM EPS: -$0.57 per share

As of 5/6/2021:

Enterprise value: $15.6 billion (!!)
Market cap: $4.5 billion (!!)
Net debt: $11.1 billion
NTM EPS: -$3.42 per share 

AMC has more debt right now ($11.1bn) than the value of the entire business *pre-covid* ($10.8bn). So even if covid never happened, the stock would be worthless and even the debt wouldn’t recover everything. 

Somehow the business is worth 50% more now AFTER covid. Even with forward EPS down 700%. And even with more movies going direct to streaming and producers cutting the exclusive theatre window? bruh.

A family of 4 under the cutoff line of $75k income would have seen a $5600 check combined with extra ue benefits, probably means the job hunt could be put off for a month...; the checks were the biggest income infusion ever from government, so that may be a part of the story here.

May/June reports will be very important to tell whether that played a big role in what happened.

There is absolutely no way that the economy could/would grow 7-10% with ue gains that slow unless people were actively putting off taking jobs due to the stimulus being so massive that it actually replaced a month or two of income (which it in fact did for families that got it with 1-3 kids).",t3_n6uyxz,10
