Alone, RH PRT users abusing the loop won‚Äôt move the price much, but multiple algos would notice the consistent buy orders and buy shares themselves anticipating more share purchases to bring prices up further. Then trend followers and scalp traders notice the upward momentum and buy shares too. This process loops as algos, PRT users, and trend followers continue to push prices higher by continuing to buy shares, outweighing any sells on AMD. Throw in some FOMO and index fund rebalancing we have a potential recipe for a 10% increase one week.
