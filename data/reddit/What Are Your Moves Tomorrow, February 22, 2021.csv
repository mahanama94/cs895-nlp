Their share price can be misleading when interpretating how well they have recovered from the crash last March. 

For example, CCL had a $30b market cap in feb 2020, and right now has a $27.5b market cap. So CCL has almost recovered ENTIRELY from the drop. If you just look at share price, $45 in feb 2020 and $25 now, you would think there is still quite a ways to go. Remember, market cap matters, not share price.",t3_lp6i2q,49
