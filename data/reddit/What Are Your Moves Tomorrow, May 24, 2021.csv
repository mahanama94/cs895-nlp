1621820294.0,2021-05-24,wallstreetbets,gz86jsh,"During my stint as an Uber driver, I had this regular who was a stripper, a black girl who was paying her way through school by dancing at the only topless club in town. One night she told me she‚Äôd be taking next week off, so she could go meet her fiancees family. The craziest part of the story, is that her fianc√©e was an Amish guy who she met while working. She said as soon as he walked into the strip club he walked right over to her and told her she was the most beautiful creature he‚Äôd ever seen and they‚Äôd been together ever since. She was so nervous about meeting his family, she had to buy new outfits that covered her from the neck down because nothing she owned was modest enough. I guess my point is that if some Amish Chad isn‚Äôt afraid to introduce his black stripper girlfriend to his entire family, what the fuck is holding you back from living the life you want to live? Get out there and fuck shit up this week.
