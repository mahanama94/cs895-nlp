The only way a squeeze will happen is if investors decide for no other reason other than forcing a squeeze to buy the stock and drive up the price, forcing either a gamma squeeze thus triggering a short squeeze if price goes high enough or margin call.  Unless there are some huge players going long who decide to drive price up, and apes decide to buy not sell when price is going up, I'm feeling like a forced squeeze is now unlikely.

Another anecdotal scenario is people with low grade broadband. My brother is on Satellite internet. It's good enough for his gaming needs, but slow enough to be burdensom to download games/patches.

However, splits do affect market sentiment of people who haven't been following stocks, new investors, etc. i.e. splits do drive liquidity. People are more comfortable buying 4 shares of $50 stock then 1 share of $200 stock in the same sector... I know it doesn't make any sense but historically there has been a strong correlation between liquidity and splits.

One case in which splits definitely have an effect is options. Since you can only buy contracts of 100 shares at the minimum, splitting a $100 share 4:1 would drive a lot of retail traders into getting options that would have previously stayed away from them due to the high buy in cost.",t1_gru64xy,22

1616443326.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grul3ch,"How does that work, actually, if the stock splits with outstanding options? Do the options automatically get re-written averaging them down the same percentage? And would that be based on the current share price? That does sound confusing",t1_grua00g,8
1616442673.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grujmvi,"In reality the best thing for us is people holding their actual shares to keep them off the market, driving down supply

That way any increase in volume is greater when compared to the liquid flow",t1_gruejh3,4
1616440550.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,gruex8w,"The game is rigged, they have the information and they will use it for maximize gains for them and so you loose. Simple as that. It’s a mafia, this is a pyramid scam with extra steps in a massive proportion and blind eyes by the goverment. 

It’s so clear now.

HF and MM and brokers and banks are all in bed together sharing the same pie which is feast on the retail investors money....",t1_gruejh3,1
1616450961.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grv1eb0,"Only if executed and also super risky, especially for the average ape that doesn’t Understand how it works. There is plenty of DD explaining why options and calls hurt apes and it’s been clear from the start that our play in buy and hold. Please don’t spread misinformation my friend.",t1_gruldu7,7
1616503916.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grx8t69,"Oh yeah, definitely. Even if their positiv I don't think their gonna be a huge catalyst. All expectations on GME and its future lie in Ryan Cohen.",t1_grvph16,2
1616443546.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grulkta,"Just like the RKT special dividend where strike prices adjusted down about a dollar and change, contracts will split to keep the same overall value before and after",t1_grul3ch,8
1616458151.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grvftio,"The best thing for a squeeze when working with limited capital would be weekly deep ITM calls.  The call writer is going to need to purchase 100 shares or very close to it to hedge, so you're effectively pulling 100 shares off the market for the price of 20 or so without paying a ton in premium because there isn't much extrinsic value in a 4 day call.

But buying and holding is a lot less hassle for sure.",t1_grujmvi,2
1616446146.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grurae7,"So if they did a 4-1 split, every one options contract would become 4 contracts?",t1_grulkta,6
1616460815.0,2021-01-30,wallstreetbets,grvkyl3,"From what I understand the itm calls are already hedged when you buy them, but I see how they would cover more shares per $ value, only thing is if you sell it when it's over, you aren't getting to keep the shares",t1_grvftio,1
