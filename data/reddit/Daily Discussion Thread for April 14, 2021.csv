Mr Powell: ""We are definitely happy with the results so far but we are still a long way to go from where we want to be before we can consider ending QE or raising rates. The reality is, unemployment is still above 0%, cancer is still around, and the sky is still blue. What we are looking for is negative unemployment, and what we mean by this is we want people to hold multiple jobs. We want cancer to be eliminated. And finally, we want the sky to become green.

He said he'd get 500. In my head, I thought he got $500 worth. I completely forgot about it for about the last 15 or so years. Yesterday I called him and asked ""Hey remember when you bought $500 worth of Nvidia stock? It's probably worth like 40 grand now if you're still holding it!"" 

He said he was still holding, but made one correction. He didn't buy $500 worth, he bought 500 shares, and it's now worth over $300k.
