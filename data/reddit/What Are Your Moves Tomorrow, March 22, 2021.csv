 Last week was the first time since 'Nam I saw someone post a decent play in the daily thread that wasn't one of the 9 different stocks talked about here lately.

But they say nobody ever went broke taking profits. $1,000 isn't a lot of money, but it's $1,000 that I didn't have before and all it took was a one liner comment that *wasn't* GME AMC RKT PLTR  etc. 

What was awesome about wsb that I feel like is lacking lately was all the different tickers that people would talk about and different plays they were making.
