So if something happens and I lose my job, or I need to make a big purchase, I can draw quick cash and therefore keep minimum amounts of cash on hand.  Basically it's a safety net for a month while I move money around.

Here's what these fuckers say:  We're not accepting new applications for Personal Lines of Credit or CD/Savings Secured Lines of Credit due to the economic uncertainty created by COVID-19.

Due to economic uncertainty.  Well no shit you don't want to be leveraged during a panedmic, but fuck you for taking away something I've had for YEARS AND YEARS.

Edit:  Here's the opening of the letter I got in the mail:  We regret to inform you that we are no longer offering Line of Credit as part of the bank's credit offerings and the recent review of your account shows that there has been no account activity for at least 12 months. For these reasons, we closed your account s of November 4, 2020.
