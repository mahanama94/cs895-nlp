RH CEO:  ""I think a large part of it is the time horizon.  People who are investing for the first time in their 20s or 30s have a very different outlook than people who are maybe a handful of years from retirement.  When you're younger you know there's decades of compound returns and decades of riding out the ups and downs of the market.""
