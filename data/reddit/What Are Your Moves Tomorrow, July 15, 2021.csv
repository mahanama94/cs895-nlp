I bought a phone a few years ago. It involved about three months of research comparing 6-8 different brands before I pulled the trigger. I ended up with a phone I love (oneplus 6T), but I'm still going to do the same thing next time around.

Contrast that with my wife two months ago. She just walked into an apple store and bought the newest model. No hesitation. Just pure conviction. She did the same thing a month later with a laptop.

Imagine having a customer base that dedicated. I mean yeah, technically other companies make the same things that Apple does, but in reality they have no real competition.",t1_h57cewm,26
