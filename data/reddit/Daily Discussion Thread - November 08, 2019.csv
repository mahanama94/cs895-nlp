2019-11-08,wallstreetbets,f6xb3gu,"**Magical Crayons TA.**

It's the year the machines took over SPY. Throughout the day I told you all of the supports and the price points we'd probably hit. We hit them. I guessed we'd stay in the wedge. We did. The problem is I'm a dumb human looking at crayons that I drew, after sticking a few into my nose and into my brain. I shouldn't be right. I was.

Volume blows dick. Bullish market. Bear gang dead. Skynet has taken over. What does this mean?

We're still in the rising wedge that's supposed to resolve by Nov 14. JPow testifying to Congress at the same time. On that same date, the first public impeachment hearing will also be held.

At his last testimony in July, the market did not in a negative fashion as he suggested rate cuts. We've cut them already. 

Based on patterns, euphoria will continue. Crayons say 309.5-310 before close on Tuesday. Given the closure of the bond market on Monday, if we see bullish trading without real news I'll put my money where my mouth is and buy puts either Tuesday or Wednesday if we are still trading in the rising wedge pattern ranges I outlined. The news events I listed above will be used as an excuse for why a pullback may occur, but really, it's an excuse to cover up the fact that Skynet is here and see the same things I'm seeing. If we trade flat and exit the rising wedge I'll stay on the sidelines.

If you're bullish and think the wedge will resolve positively, anticipate a jump to 313-315 at/around mid-week or flat trading for the rest of the week. If you're bearish, the support is 307ish, which is the puts I will grab if we enter the ranges I mentioned above. Because sentiment is still bullish, too OTM puts are at your own risk.

Have a great weekend and see you all in the weekend thread. I'll be hugging my tinfoil hats and shoving more crayons into various orifices. Let's all make tendies in honor of the autists that tried to crumble RH.",t3_dtdwpg,19

2019-11-08,wallstreetbets,f6wk3vi,"Repo for today was solid. The total NY Fed repo ops for the week is 436.5 Billion. Almost half a trillion dollars in a week. Additionally added 300B to the balance sheet in the last 2 months. 

I know that they mainly get paid back next day, but a loan is a loan. If you get a payday loan for 100 bucks, pay it back, then get another 100 bucks the next day you still took 200 in loans.

Kind of mind blowing the levels of money being handled just to keep us where we are. Total Repo ops have move from a steady 1.6T from 2014-2016 to a last print of 2.46T in 10/2019. An additional trillion a month in lending.
