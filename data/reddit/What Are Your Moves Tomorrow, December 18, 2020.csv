1608239976.0,2020-12-18,wallstreetbets,gg6k6f2,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Market touches new ATH today with S&P and Nasdaq closing at 3,722 and 12,765, up 0.57% and 0.84%, respectively. Meanwhile, every tech stock is up except for the tech calls I'm holding which are being ass fucked by theta. The fuck? Game is rigged. Stop the count!
* You know the drill. Stimulus talks going well. Pelosi optimistic this morning and WH says a deal within 24-48 hrs. More details emerged last night of the package in helping plebs. As mentioned, instead of the previous $1,200 per person, Congress is tossing us a bone in the form of $600 per person. But wait, there's more! They ""found"" funding for this by slashing UI extension from 16 weeks to 12 weeks, thereby further screwing over the 10 millions or so people out of work. 
* Problem with the above is that McTurtle has stated that it is ""highly likely"" Senators will have to work thru the weekend, and they may fund a very short interim bill to fund the govt over the weekend. Putting in doubt once again on when stimulus will be finalized.
* Weekly jobless claims ""unexpectedly"" rise says the big brain bois at CNBC, hitting highest levels since Sept. The # of first-time claims reached 885,000 this week, vs 808k last week (and 700k or whatever before that). But don't worry, these are all bullish signals. (Real talk tho, forward-looking market has moved well beyond jobless claims and covid case count).
* SEC once again has thrown the books at Robinhood, charging them with deceiving customers about how RH makes money and fucking over WSB with poor order execution (this is for the period of 2015 to 2018). Turns out, it's not just the low liquidity OTM FD you're buying that's the problem. Who knew!? Robinhood agrees to pay $65 mil in penalty without admitting fault. But we all know their fill is shit as they front-run your poorly thought-out FDs to Citadel.
* SEC and LK (LKNCY) has also settled, with the Chinese SBUX wannabe paying $180 million in penalty for their fraudulent accounting charges, without admitting wrongdoing. The stock on OTC market soar 96.52% today, closing at $7.35. Shares had been trading in the $2 to high $4 ranges since its implosion in April from $26 (with its 52-week high at $51.38).
* In IPO land, Coinbase has filed for IPO as shitcoins continues to skyrocket to new heights (currently at $23k a pop). ABNB continues its recovery from its recent fade as the stock was up 8% during the intraday high. WISH gets a bounce from yesterday's IPO disappointment as the stock is up more than 13% during intraday high, though it never did reach the offering price of $24. Both closed about 2% below their intraday highs.
* GOOGL gets hit with its THIRD antitrust suit, this time by 38 freaking states and territories. No doubt antitrust will be the big news for big tech as 2021 rolls around and the new administration and justice department rolls in.
* Leading homebuilder Lennar (LEN) says 2020 was the best year ever in its 65 years history as interest rates continue to be dirt cheap and non-poor Millennials are starting families and picking up starter homes (or bling homes if they've been all-in since March). The same sentiment was echoed at Toll Brothers (TOL), with their CEO saying it's the strongest housing market he's seen in his 30 years at the luxury home builder.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up 4.71%, breaking the $27 channel again and closed at 5% up to $27.23; GME rose to as high as $14.98 and ended the day at +7% at $14.83; finally, MT ends the day relatively flat at +1% despite the initial pump to $24+ in the morning. Option flow continues to be strong for MT monthlies as steel gang goes all-in after the underlying is up 10% for the week, 43% for the month, and 70% for the past 3 months. Can't go tits up.
* Notable ER after the bell today: FDX (down ~3%), SCS (down ~8%), and BB (5:30 PM ET). Notable ERs and events tomorrow: NKE reports after the bell and good o' Quad Witching with Dec 18 OpEx.

Pre-market we could hear the bears in no-man‚Äôs land, baiting us towards higher prices so the shorts could do their dirty work.  I was stationed at the 13.80 line, and knew the morning was going to be hot.  I shoveled a breakfast of tendies and said a quick prayer to Father Cohen.

When the bell rang, the bears surged into our trenches.  Blood and rainbow fur filled the air and littered the ground.  The Diamond Division has seen worse days, and we held firm.  As the bears retreated we gave chase to retake ground we‚Äôd lost in the past week.

As I caught my breath near the 14.50, I could see bodies everywhere; paper hands who had fallen in earlier battles.  One of them groaned and reached a hand towards me.  I spat on him and kept moving.  No honor in retreat, and no sympathy for self-inflicted wounds.

Will probably be last post of the night unless my buddy sends me something big.  Just some things I might have missed but might be covered in news (idk Ive been swamped with work and haven't really had a chance to talk to my connect):

1. Staffers have been told to stay until at least the 23rd.  Not necessarily related to covid or omnibus but moreso tied to section 230 and defense spending bill. Noone has an idea when trump will sign it but rumors (everything else I post is substantiated this is literally just bullshit being thrown around dc) are that he's waiting until the last minute to keep everyone in DC because he's pissed at McConnell lol  

 One of two things will happen (and neither are good): we repeal section 230 or our military won't have funding until January 20th.  Pretty plainly laid out there.  Market probably booms either way. 

2. There is still no bill.  Different elements have been sent out to different committees but there is still not a single written stimulus bill draft to be reviewed.  I don't really know the processes behind this but my buddy said there's like a .005% chance it gets passed tomorrow just from a procedural perspective.  His congressperson hasn't received one piece of legislation - but this also doesn't mean much since he's lame duck. 

3.  There has been an order from leadership in both parties for everyone to shut the fuck up and stop discussing the nuances of the bill in public.  Getting a bill done at this point is more important to leadership than what's in the bill.  Rand paul and the freedom caucus keep finding different things to shit on.  Progressive caucus has actually been conducive to negotiations but my buddy thinks it's because committee assignments are happening and they didn't wanna fuck up their chances.  AOC just lost a big vote against a moderate Democrat so they might go balls out tomorrow. 

4.  This russia hack is a big fucking deal.  Everyone's email has been compromised.  They had and currently have access to everything.  Staffers are freaking the fuck out.",t3_kf65et,39

The US Government internally is at a code red -- or one of the highest levels of national security threat. We have been straight up attacked by a foreign entity or an insider. We are not being told the extent as to what is happening regarding this recent hack because the US Government might be seriously fucked. The Federal Government at this point is saying that they have no idea what the intentions of this hack were nor do they even know how many people / agencies were affected besides what we know now.

The lack of coverage in media and from the Government is proving to me that this is in fact one of those moments in history where the WH might be on an actual code red status and we will get word from them once things are more 'secure'.

SUMMARY:

The lack of coverage on the SolarWinds Hack that came to light Sunday (when government agencies removed the compromised program, 'Orion') makes me extremely nervous.

The sophisticated hackers were able to upload scripts in an update to the Orion platform as early as March. Clients who downloaded this software update were then unwillingly being monitored in a capacity that we don't even know yet. The US Government still has no idea what the hackers accomplished, how many agencies were compromised (SolarWinds says ~18,000 clients out of 300,000*)

The IRS has confirmed they were hacked. We might never know what information was stolen / transferred / modified / damaged ever. Senators urging IRS commissioner for briefings as we speak:",t3_kf65et,24

1608239592.0,2020-12-18,wallstreetbets,gg6jfh5," **TESLA INFO FOR TOMORROW:**

Tomorrow at eod, the closing price will be used to set the weight and the price for the sp500 inclusion. This is because most of the tracking funds will be trying to buy as close as possible to the eod of price to minimize variance (index tracking errors, which is their funds performance to the actual sp500 performance). So how will these funds accomplish this? Simple, its called an on close order. There are two types, market on close, and limit on close. These are almost identical to the market orders and limit orders. The only catch as per Nasdaq, Market on close orders must be received prior to 3:55pm, and Limit on close orders must be received before 3:58pm. Therefore, if the funds do not get the required # of shares they need to be filled by 4:00pm, this will cause a buying imbalance, essentially shooting up the price of the stock and dictating that the price will go up next week, as there is more demand than supply. **HOWEVER,** if there is more supply than demand, then tesla stocks price will decrease greatly, as everyone who has been holding, will be trying to get rid of as much of the shares as possible.

What about dark pool activities?

All dark pool activity must be reported almost immediately (within 10secs of transaction) so if any sells or buys were happening, it would have been consolidated and yahoo finance would most probably have reported it.
