* Buy and hold
* Diversify
* Rebalance from time to time.

No one thinks that you should buy and hold one thing forever because that one thing might go bankrupt and you might be missing out on something else which is sky rocketing. What they mean by ""buy and hold"" is don't fucking sell because of short term dips. If you time them wrong it can be disaaaaastrous cause not only do you sell for a loss of whatever% but if you don't get back in before things come back up you could miss out on huge gains on the up swing. 

From this article: https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/31/missing-just-a-few-of-the-best-stock-market-days-c/

>How much exactly? 
JPMorgan's asset management arm has put an exact price to these missed days in its Guide to Retirement report. If you invested $10,000 into the S&P 500 on Jan. 3, 2000 and left it completely invested until Dec. 31, 2019, you would've received an average annual return of just over 6%. Your $10,000 would've grown to $32,421.

>This 20-year period of time includes roughly 5,000 days during which the stock market was open. But as the table below shows, if you missed just the 10 best days out of those 5,000, you'd have less than half as much money. Miss the best 20 days, and you'd barely have made any money at all over 20 years, and you'd have lost money if you missed more winning days.

Time Invested Since Jan. 3, 2000	
Dollar Value 	Annualized Performance

* Fully invested into S&P 500	$32,421	6.06%

* Missed 10 best days 
$16,180	2.44%

* Missed 20 best days
$10,176	0.08%

* Missed 30 best days 
$6,749	(1.95%)

* Missed 40 best days 
$4,607	(3.8%)

* Missed 50 best days
$3,246	(5.47%)
