1599858099.0,2020-09-11,wallstreetbets,g4v530s,"## Daily Market and Options Summary for Today -

## Daily Synopsis 

* The S&P 500 increased 0.1% on this 19th anniversary of 9/11 but continued selling in the mega-caps limited the upside. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.7%) closed lower. 
* Similar to the days before, today's price action was technically-oriented given the absence of market-moving news and the losses in stocks like Apple (AAPL 112.00, -1.49, -1.3%), Amazon (AMZN 3116.22, -58.89, -1.9%), and Microsoft (MSFT 204.03, -1.34, -0.7%) on no specific corporate news. Apple shares fell 7.4% this week. 
* The difference today was that their losses were offset by relative strength in the cyclical sectors, namely industrials (+1.4%), materials (+1.3%), and financials (+0.8%). Still, when Apple and Amazon are down more than 1.0%, there must be more winners than losers to make a meaningful difference. 
* There were more of the latter on Friday, as declining issues outpaced advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq. The information technology (-0.8%), consumer discretionary (-0.3%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors ended the day in negative territory due to their exposure to the mega-cap stocks. 
* Interestingly, the S&P 500 was down as much as 0.9% intraday and fell below its 50-day moving average (3322). A broad rebound in the afternoon, however, helped the benchmark index turn positive and close above the key technical level. 
* Shares of Oracle (ORCL 57.00, -0.33, -0.6%), Peloton (PTON 84.04, -3.71, -4.2%), and Kroger (KR 34.37, -0.37, -1.1%) finished lower following their earnings reports. Note, ORCL shares were up as much as 7.9%, and PTON shares were up as much as 11.8%. 
* U.S. Treasuries finished on a higher note. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 93.28. WTI crude futures increased 0.2%, or $0.07, to $37.34/bbl.
* There are no notable economic reports scheduled for Monday.
