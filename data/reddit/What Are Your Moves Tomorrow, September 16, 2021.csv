1) When checking Options Profit Calculator to see what you could potentially make, change the IV setting to -x %. This number changes with the stock but if a -10% is possible you might as well factor for it. If the IV crush doesn't come then you'll be pleasantly surprised with a higher payout than anticipated because you planned for a flood. 

2) Check and see what the average Implied Volatility is for that particular ticker. You can use shit like Market Chameleon for free but knowing weather or not IV is high or low matters when buying calls.
