We're for the most part inhabitable, unwantable bits of concrete and metal. We smell and taste bitter, we don't have enough water, and we're *hard*. Proudly so. Impenetrable, really. From the first time we fall walking as a toddler, we learn to defend. Close up. Even the open and brave and extroverted among us do this: default to saying no to danger, to others.

Loving someone is letting someone grow on you anyway. No, not *letting*. For most of us, it happens without our permission or noticing at first. Someone plants an invisible seed with a laugh or a song recommendation or the way their hair moves when they walk, and then their roots find something *under there*, under you. Not much, but enough. And they grow, and you helplessly watch as they grow, and if you are lucky, they grow into an oak tree, and the hard defenses of your concrete buckle and melt like butter, and you don't feel the breaking because you so enjoy the shade.
