https://www.wsj.com/articles/bridgewater-bets-big-on-market-drop-11574418601

>Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, a hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio, has bet more than $1 billion that stock markets around the world will fall by March, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

>The bet, assembled over a span of months and executed by a handful of Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley , would pay off for the world's biggest hedge fund if either the S&P 500 <.SPX> or the Euro Stoxx 50 <.STOXX50E> ‚Äî or both ‚Äî declines, the report said.

>The bet is made up of put options, contracts that give investors the right to sell stocks at a specific price by a certain date. The options expire in March and currently represent one of the largest bearish bets against the market, the report added.

Bridgewater Associates was not immediately available for comment.
