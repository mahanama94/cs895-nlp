You don’t want to be the guy at the office who blew it with Big Booty Judy cause your chicken was lookin drier than my wallet after ladies night, so follow these recipes. 

For a simple honey mustard marinade, combine
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup dijon mustard
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup olive oil

Pop that saucy minx in a bag with some chicken thighs and BOOM, you just bought a one way ticket to poundtown, first class.

Your girl don’t like sweet shit? That’s all good, she sweet enough as it is. Just throw some chicken breasts in a bag with some pesto. You won’t have to worry about what to do for those three hours because just the sight of you not being a fuckin idiot for once is gonna have that sweet girl finger-poppin your asshole quicker than you can find the lube.
