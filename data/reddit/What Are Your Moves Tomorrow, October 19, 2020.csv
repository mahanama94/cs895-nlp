One of my good friends went to school for CS, when he first got out he was hella depressed, felt like he wasted his time, and basically had huge regrets about university. 6 months later and he had a big baller job, was saving money and living like a king, he went from like a quiet stoner kid to being a grown ass man in a matter of a few months when he started realizing what he had built with his years of hard work. point is, you're doing ok man, be easy on yourself, just keep grinding and focusing on the next step",t1_g99shh4,13
