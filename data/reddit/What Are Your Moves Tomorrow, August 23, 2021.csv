A) JPOW says turn the money printer off, and the market gets a full Correction and dives up to 15%

B) JPOW says turn the money printer off, and the market initially dives, but then everybody remembers it was priced in, and recovers sometime between a week and a month later.

C) JPOW says leave the money printer on, and the market gets back to green within a couple days.

NVDA calls

AMD calls

PFE calls

(High risk) MRNA calls

**Gameplan:**

Take profits on tuesday at close cuz the fed is talking on wed, thur, fri so everything will tank a little.

Be patient on choppy days. Thats the key here and the difference between being profitable and blowing all your load on choppy days (which will rekt you portfolio). **Cash IS a position too**.

On friday, try to buy calls at a discount for next week

**Bonus:** YOLO leap, this could pay up bigly if gold moons from here (it will).
