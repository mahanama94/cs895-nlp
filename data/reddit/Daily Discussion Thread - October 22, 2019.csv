The BMS trial was only announced to have met its endpoint, no data yet, so not clear if efficacy is better than Pembrolizumab + chemo. The combo of Nivolumab and Ipimumab (BMS) is known to be more toxic vs. Pembrolizumab (MRK). No Nivolumab only + Chemo arm, so will be hard for FDA to assess if Ipilimumab is actually needed for efficacy. Bottomline: not clear if this will get approved, let alone whether is is the better option compared to Pembrolizumab.
