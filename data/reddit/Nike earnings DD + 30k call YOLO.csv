I feel terrible knowing that people might be in a bad financial spot now because they trusted me and followed me into this play. While WSB is all about YOLO'ing and short-term gains, it is always crucial to assess your risks, take profits where you can and make sure to focus on what really matters.

HOWEVER, you did call that they'd best EPS estimates and they did, so your thesis on market trends was probably correct on the consumer side. Looks like supply chains are just a huge hurdle right now and guidance looks down. 

Don't best yourself up. Whatever your methods is it's working. Don't forget you aren't responsible for people losing money here. You just provide DD. Good luck on future trades I will be following for sure!

Hell, some of my DD's in April and especially the last one in June were absolutely TERRIBLE calls because the market was roiled and I had not yet adjusted to a rotation to headline driven market action that's taken hold the last 5 months or so.  It sucks knowing you made a bad call when you are trying to be helpful, but even the best traders are only right 70% of the time.  I'll be reading your DD's in the future because I generally like your process and evaluation (unlike most here), though it's unlikely I'll follow in most trades because I make my own calls but you might tip me off to an equity I'm not familiar with to study.  Adults followed you in because they liked what you had to say about this stock.  They rolled their own dice, whatever happens is on them.

&#x200B;

2)   However, I've read your other DD's and have generally found them sound, but this one was just so obviously going to go badly that I'm still baffled how you even got to this thesis.  Like, there was absolutely nothing to indicate this was going to go up.  There was no unknown data that came out of nowhere like funny accounting tricks to create a surprise beat or Winnie the Pooh fucking the global economy out of nowhere.  I mean, there was only about a 5% chance this was going to work out.  I strongly suggest you take a step back and evaluate your information gathering process and identify the giant hole that was exposed in your research process that led you to think this was something you should have done anything but hoped you would one day regret not doing as a coulda/shoulda/woulda on th e very off chance it went green.  There's a learning opportunity in here for you.  Until I see your next thesis and it's sound, I'm gonna start calling you Icarus.  Earn your name back :)",t1_he3efmt,20

In all seriousness, I see that you mentioned conservative options for the trade. This tells me you‚Äôre not just any retard. I hope you quickly accept and move onto making gains once more. As you now know, and possibly even knew before, one sided bets are not friendly during market with increased volatility. For the newbs out there, to gauge whether a strangle is worth it or not, you want to follow rVol of either /nq /es futures or indices. If they are high, an earnings strangle trade could be profitable, and one sided bet could easily take out entire position. If rvol is low, then just don‚Äôt force a trade. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up OP, just add this as a lesson moving forward. Have to learn from every single experience or the market will eat you alive.
