Rallied 12% that day, Feb. 3rd. to $112. Reached $118 over the next week but now down to probably $110 tomorrow. 

SNE is a screaming buy. This is the kind of pullback you love to take advantage of. Has zero to do with sony. Just a healthy market pullback.

Gaming, music, and image sensors are worth Sony's modest $130B market cap alone. You basically get a free electronics, robotics, movie and television business, high end camera, Japanese insurance conpany, and financial services company for free... And everyone of those divisions are *strongly profitable.* Their electronics division made a $980 million dollar profit last quarter alone. They have shed all of their low margin products and now sell only the best tvs, headphones, and cameras in the world. Just look at their last earnings report. It was incredible. 

Sony's 14x multiple is crazy low. The company was founded 1 year after wwii ended, and will be around for another 100 years. 

They also own 3% of spotify and 33% of a Japanese e-health giant, M3, that is valued at $54B.

Their cash on hand is $22B. Back that off their market cap and they trade at like 11x earnings. *Screaming buy.*",t3_lqswtl,37
