1603448462.0,2020-10-23,wallstreetbets,g9quaee,"A little earlier than I anticipated, but might YOLO on DKNG. The bottom might be in.

* TN, MI, and VA are all now on track to have legalized sports betting. Sports betting is on the ballot in several other states like MD as well. There could be a wave of new states for sports betting, with up to 8% more of the entire population of the US now allowed to bet.

* CEO Jason Robbins had $200M in shares vest on 10/20. At the moment they invest, the IRS considers it to be earned ordinary income that is taxed at 40%, meaning he'd be on the hook for a gargantuan tax bill of $90M. To avoid that, a portion of his shares were withheld to accomodate the taxes. This was done simultaneously with the vesting, because if the stock dives for any reason you get royally screwed. Tax planning 101. Also, by vesting in the $40s vs the $60s where DKNG was trading at, Robbins saved almost $40M in taxes, because any appreciation from $40s from this point forward means he'll be taxed instead at a capital gains rate of 15%. Insiders were thus motivated to have a lower stock price on the day of vesting on 10/20.  Robbins is a lot smarter than all of the dumb angry RobinHood traders who were cussing him out of the performance of the stock on Twitter.

* The partnership with Turner is a much bigger deal that isn't getting talked about a lot. Turner has exclusive rights to broadcast March Madness, which is a gigantic sports betting cash cow. Turner also owns Bleacher Report, which is basically #2 for sports news/discussion next to ESPN. It gives DKNG a huge leg up on competition for brand exposure. Even Disney, who owns ESPN, is buying up DKNG. DKNG is getting brand exposure via the top two biggest outlets for sports coverage.

* NFL stating 2 days ago that they'll have the Super Bowl in March if they have to. It basically means the NFL is virtually 100% committed to completing the season with the challenges of COVID, no matter what. It removes a lot of uncertainty regarding NFL cancelling its season. We're already basically half way done the season at this point anyway; the only way football will stop is if the government intervenes and forces them to.

Jan $55 calls it is. The short term plunge is bullshit smoke and mirrors having to do with all sorts of issues with insiders getting vested shares to PIPE investors from the SPAC merger being able to unload in Oct. All of the bullshit is over.",t3_jgkeqo,28

There are in fact alternatives and they‚Äôre called anything else including cash. You might say yeah right inflation will kill cash and stocks are a better store of value but that doesn‚Äôt give any consideration to the relative cost of stocks.

There have been bear markets where the only thing that caused stocks to go down were valuations themselves. Consensus is TINA and just about every person I‚Äôve listened to on CNBC agrees and believes stocks will go up next year. I‚Äôm thinking what about the gains we‚Äôve seen over the past 12 months? Apple has doubled. Surely we‚Äôve pulled forward a lot of returns in equities and the smart money has been in these stocks for months and years. It‚Äôs insane to think stocks will provide great returns after the gains they‚Äôve already shown.

The fact that everyone thinks it‚Äôs so easy to make money by simply holding these tech stocks makes me nervous and thinking that entire trade has topped and we‚Äôre setup for some severe pain going forward. Meanwhile tech stocks have quietly been trending down for the past couple weeks while everyone seems convinced they‚Äôre the best and only investment option until further notice. ü§î",t3_jgkeqo,9
