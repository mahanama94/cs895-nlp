1571691784.0,2019-10-21,wallstreetbets,f4npgb8,"Hello and welcome back to **Magical Crayons TA.**

No interesting news in the broad market today, but we have a very large trading window because of numerous catalysts upcoming. As all you autists know, it is an action-packed earnings week. Price action will probably reflect the strength of the earnings so I will note some potential scenarios.

Today we broke slightly above the lower end of the two previous week's momentum trading, but since we were hovering below there for most of last week's flat gayness, I would not be expecting any rocketships until we test upcoming resistances. The most important will be the 300.7ish range, which if broken, should lead to a momentum pop upwards to 301 swiftly before the next resistances.

As mentioned, we are in a bullish trading pattern so even if results are neutral/mixed, I think it is inevitable we make the climb to that 300.7ish range. The question if when. Magical crayons suggest we hit it before EOD tomorrow, and if so, be prepared for a break upwards to 301.2 or 301.3 before a pullback to that 301. If earnings are more negative, we have resistances at 299 and 297.5-- so if we open below 299, expect those two numbers as the new trading ranges for the day. EDIT: I forgot to include the ranges if we open flat-- it should be 300.5-299.05 if we don't successfully climb upwards.

Bless all your portfolios and many tendies upon you.",t3_dkyw9m,13

Is it just me or do you guys think Boeing is absolutely fucked?

1.	BA hid 2016 text messages for months regarding the 737 MAX MCAS system being flawed
2.	737 MAX new orders have plummeted 
3.	Huge bull run from 2016-2018 was because of the imminent success of the MAX, stonk price back then was almost half of what it is today
4.	BA downgrades coming this week (should be illegal cuz ‘Murica but these fuckers have murdered hundreds of people)
5.	BA earnings Wednesday premarket, could be disastrous for the company, if there are order cancellations, missed $$ targets/rev/EPS.. buybacks are like a bandaid and can’t cover a gushing wound
6.	Important 350-360 magnetic (how the fuck do they work 🧲) level was absolutely annihilated on Friday. BA has been hanging around this area for a while before their massive run up and crash earlier this year
7.	Important levels are 319.55 (August low), 292.47 (December 2018 correction low)... 
8.	CEO will be fired, won’t be good for the stock, which sometimes is a positive catalyst for struggling companies... BA hasn’t been struggling.. it’s been fucking up
9.	Major issues with other non-737 MAX planes, cracks in planes

There are some things BA has going for it. Buybacks. Trump. Trade deals.

Tinfoil hat time: I think BA is being destroyed from the inside.

Price target: $200 and below. This is the price range before the MAX was certified.",t3_dkyw9m,5
