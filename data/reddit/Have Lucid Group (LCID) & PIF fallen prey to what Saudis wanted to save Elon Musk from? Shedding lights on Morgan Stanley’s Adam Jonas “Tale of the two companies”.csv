Adam Jonas is definitely an ass-hat and many have voiced suspicions that his PTs in the EV sector are more about manipulation.

Also see my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/pns836/consider_jonas_track_record_with_fisker_before/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)… saying Jonas set a ridiculous $27 PT for Fisker in February (see [here](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fisker-stock-price-morgan-stanley-overweight-stands-out-ev-space-2021-2)) when the stock was trading at $15. It briefly shot up 26% on that PT and then immediately plummeted. Some smelled manipulation. He later served up a repeat performance with a $40 PT in August (see [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/08/10/heres-why-fisker-stock-shot-up-today/)) causing a short lived 30% spike. Fisker is currently trading at $13.32.

[Another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCIV/comments/pns836/consider_jonas_track_record_with_fisker_before/hcrg5te/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) showed that Jonas was [and still is](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FSR/price-target/) far and away the outlier with a $40 PT for Fisker. Literally every other analyst is calling that one better than he is. 

Others have pointed out his nonsense calls with wildly broad ranges (under the guise of “bull” and “bear” cases) and lowball calls for $TSLA. 

Lesson: take his PTs *especially in the EV sector* with a huge mound of salt and skepticism, if not cynicism. Better still, maybe take them with suspicion of *market manipulation* for the benefit of Morgan Stanley.",t3_ponsxc,5

The company has been under short selling attack for several months. 

Okay so..... Soo...... Short sellers are short selling a company with no production target and no communicated plan.

End of story.

That's the story.

The story is that LCID doesn't have a known plan to reach any of these targets. It doesn't mean they *won't* (theoretically) but it sure as fuck means they don't seem to have a way to do it.

&nbsp;

Annnd that exact same reasoning is why all the valuation of TSLA's *actual product lines* is given fair weight for market value, while LCID's is not. LCID simply has no proof of any of their shit, TSLA is *the* market leader in EVs right now.

Do you think the Air moves around town by rolling down hills using gravity? Do you think the factory is empty on the inside? Do you believe everything is smoke and mirrors?

Cuz, that's what it fucking sounds like. Sounds like most, hell maybe even ALL the LM haters, think it's a scam, that it's fake, that it doesn't exist. That it isn't happening.

You're either scared shitless, chain by the ankle to Mr. M, or are simply allowing yourself to be taken advantage of.

Lordstown sucks. Nikola is a lie. Lucid Motors is delivering their finished product WITHIN 30 DAYS. Why are you still trying to compared LM with all these other bullshit, scam, not-very-real companies? We knew this thing was real in like, January lol.

The answer is really easy if you can step outside of the salty Lucid fanboy rant for a second... Lucid hasn't made a car yet.  Kind of hard to provide platforms for other manufacturers when you can't even make your own cars yet.

In fact Adam told you exactly that, and you quoted it. (I put it in nice bold letters for you)

So you apparently don't know anything about LM but you do go ahead and claim they have no future plan and no communication and it's all a big fat scam/ lie. Am I reading that right?

Thanks for making a completely useless and irrelevant comment?

The reality is, there is a plan, there is communication. We know what the company is struggling with and what they are getting absolutely right. There's no mysticism or smoke and mirrors. Sure, they could be more direct and state some more concrete things. But for anyone actually following along with LM and who gives a shit and doesn't just want to trash them simply because they aren't Tesla, we do know that the company has a plan and they are executing it.

You seem to think Lucid is just out there floundering....you seem to not know what you're talking about lol.

Point me to one thing Lucid Motors ISN'T doing, that they've been working on.

Air Production? In progress.

Deliveries? Within 30 days.

New vehicles? Already designed, planned, factory expansion is currently underway.

Saudi Arabia? They're getting a factory for EV, like they wanted.
