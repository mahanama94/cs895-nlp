1573676834.0,2019-11-13,wallstreetbets,f7fd0t8,"Hello everyone, it is time for **Magical Crayons TA.**

No change from yesterday's post, flat day. The one thing to note is today's flatness is probably in part influenced by the abrupt mooning of DIS and continued mooning of AAPL, which represent >5% weight of its holdings. Looking broadly across other sectors, we had mostly flat or slightly red days (i.e. the other FAANGs). WMT will be interesting to watch tomorrow-- it doesn't weigh heavily on the SPY but can be a proxy for things like retail interest.

I was admittedly surprised at the complete flatness on the part of SPY today in response to the JPow testimony, drops in Treasury yields, and increasing trade deal uncertainty-- I expected a move one way or the other for at least 0.25% intraday. With the slowing of earnings season and the release of more economic news tomorrow and Friday, I still expect some volatility (positive or negative). However today's muted market response has surprised me enough that we may just keep trading in these ranges for the rest of the week. If we do, we clear the wedge and inflection point I've noted and will probably continue a slow trickle upwards next week.

Bless you all and for those that played DIS, I am jealous but happy for your tendies.",t3_dvq8jf,11
