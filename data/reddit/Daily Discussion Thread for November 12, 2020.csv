1605205142.0,2020-11-12,wallstreetbets,gc2iege,"Ok retards. I actually did some research into EV demand and outlook in China.

The key to EV growth and demand in China is not tied to price of a gasoline powered car vs. EV, it has to do with regulations in China.

In China, apparently, there is a lottery system to obtain a license plate for a gasoline powered car. Not only is it expensive to obtain a license plate, even if you want one, it’s not guaranteed. And even if you somehow win the lottery and get a license plate, and pay the high cost to obtain one, you can only drive a gasoline powered car on certain days (i.e. odd numbered days etc). This restriction is in place to limit congestion in China.

But with EVs, there are no such restrictions right now. Obtaining a license plate is much easier than a gasoline powered car. There is no restriction on driving days. Everything is cheaper, including parking. That’s what’s driving the demand for EVs in China. Also the EV penetration rate in China is at 5% right now and it is potentially the biggest EV market in the world.

So LONG TSLA, XPENG, NIO, etc",t3_jssu2g,9
