Before your baby girl’s nap, you read her a story called “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt,” which compelled you to open Robinhood again and check your puts—even though the market wasn’t moving. You stared at these non-moving puts until your daughter cried, and as you tried to calm her down, you wondered how hard she’d cry if she knew what you did with her 529 funds.

At the end of the day, you had missionary sex with your wife and afterwards, as you rolled over to check Futures, she said “I love you.” You parroted the phrase back to her, mindlessly, as your pulse quickened watching the whims of pajama traders—quicker than it had during sex.
