1609242938.0,2020-12-29,wallstreetbets,ghdvtyi,"I made it so the ticker market cap numbers the bots use are constantly being refreshed. It does probably the whole list every 3-4 hours. I'm using yfinance python library in lieu of better data. Got suggestions? Got an uncle with an API key? It sets whether the ticker is spam or not whenever it gets a new number. The cutoff is 500mm for SPACs and 1000mm for everything else. If you find some normal word is blocked as a ticker or there's an issue just ping me. 

What would you use more, a command to check whether a ticker is spam or not or a list of tickers that you can refer to?

We're now tracking timeseries data for the first hour of a submission's life. I think I worked out the kinks. I'm hoping we can do timeseries classification deep learning type stuff with it and figure out which posts are destined for the frontpage, which gained score in an unusual and manipulated way, etc.

Stats page is getting a lot of usage. I might have to move it to its own read-only database. It keeps hogging all the connections and making the bots crash. I used connection pools but it doesn't seem to have helped somehow. 

Since we're tracking the hash of every image posted I've been tempted to turn wsb into 4chan r9k and make it so you can't repost an image more than once, maybe within a couple month grace period. It would be a hassle for people who fucked up their first post or something but it'd be kinda neat. Thoughts?",t3_kmcawr,153
