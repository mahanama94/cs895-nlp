At my lowest, I was down -70% but I diamond handed my positions and finally they're doing well. This was a big part of my net wealth. It was basically most of what I had saved over 5 years and I had lost 70% of it in less than a month.

Anyway, I'm glad to say I finally broke even last week, after one year of trading/investing, and I am up 20% all time as at today. It ain't much but I am damn grateful for it and proud of myself for not giving up and persevering. 

One lesson I learnt is that if you're down a lot, don't try and recoup it all as quickly as possible. Take a break, think about what you could have done differently. My biggest change was that I stopped playing FDs and short term options and only started playing with leaps (12 to 18 months). It's boring but it's safe and it gives you leverage. So you get the best of both stocks and options without the sleepless nights. 

Don't give up, you've got this. Everything is gonna be alright.

I will also grant you many riches, to remind the little bulls that Gay Bears can succeed. That Gay Bears are strong.”

I started cracking in May. On May 14, 2020, I commented, “I’m not addicted to trading, I already liquidated my entire portfolio and withdrew everything. I’m just addicted to WSB, literally my only source of human interaction during this lockdown.”

On July 22, 2020 at 3:36am I commented on the daily discussion thread,

“I haven’t talked to any irl friend in 2-3 weeks, haven’t logged onto any personal social media for months, and my parent live 1000s of miles away so if I do end up killing myself, no one will feel guilty or miss me. In any case, I’m gonna live the next 10 days like they’re the last 10 days of my life, doing everything right. At the end of 10 days, I’ll re-evaluate and see how I’m feeling.”



On August 19, 2020 at 5:04am, during the height of my depression, I commented,

“I fucked it up. I fucked it all up. My relationships. My friendships. My potential gf. My job. My hobbies. Everything. I fucked it all up. I fucked up my entire life. And it’s all my fault. Fuck. 😔🤡🔫”

And I was pretty close to $ROPE at that point, I had a plan to take a Lyft to the beach at night and just keep walking into the water indefinitely. Then I decided to stop worrying about my job, took some leave, visited some of my friends in different cities, read books, immersed myself in some video games, and now finally I don’t feel that bad about myself and my life anymore.
