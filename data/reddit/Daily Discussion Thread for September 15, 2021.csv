This downturn is super notable because put buys have been incredibly low, despite the fact that we've been bleeding for like 9 days.

While puts/vix are bearish, the market actually needs put volume to fuel bullish movements, for various reasons that are too complicated to explain in this shitpost. But for some reason, people aren't buying them right now. 

You can plot out NPD, VGR, and normalized SPX returns on a contour map and see how likely a large, volatile bearish event is.
