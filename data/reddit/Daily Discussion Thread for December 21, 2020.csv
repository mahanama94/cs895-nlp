December 21, 2020 03:02 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News     

**Palantir** (NYSE:[PLTR](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PLTR#NYSE))        shares are trading higher on Monday after the company announced the U.S.        Army's Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems opted        to execute the second year of its partnership with Palantir on the Army        Vantage program for $113.8 million.     

Palantir Technologies provides organizations with solutions to manage        large disparate data sets in an attempt to gain insight and drive        operational outcomes. Founded in 2003, Palantir released its Gotham        software platform in 2008, which focuses on the government intelligence        and defense sectors.     

Palantir expanded into various commercial markets with its Foundry        software platform in 2016 with the intent of becoming the data operating        system for companies and industries. The Denver, Colorado company had        125 customers as of its IPO and roughly splits its revenue between        commercial and government customers",t3_khf71h,12
