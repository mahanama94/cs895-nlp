They expected to buy back at 0, but that vice got real tight real quick. Now a large and growing group of self proclaimed apes 🦍 are basically holding to the gears to that Vice demanding $1000+ for their shares knowing they’re going to get it as long as they stand together and diamond hand the shit out of their shares.
