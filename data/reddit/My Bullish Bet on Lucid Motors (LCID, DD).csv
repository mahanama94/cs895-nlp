Given the fact that they're not first movers, they won't likely have the privileges Tesla had in terms of marketing and publicity. They have great tech, but can they spread quickly enough and create a recognizable brand? What are their plans in this area? - I see that as a challenge here.

Also their timing seems to be at a point where every major brand now has some contenders in the EV game (despite being shitty). Do you think they can go toe to toe with the likes of Audi, Mercedes, Porsche and Tesla?",t3_pasz3d,10

That p/s ratio would be high for the industry but not high if the company can sustain 100% growth for the next several years.

The question that Lucid has not answered is did they achieve that range by making a car they can mass produce or did they do so by making a more expensive car to build? That is a huge question I think. For the Air Touring you don't get more miles than a Model S LR and you don't get better performance either, and yet you pay a lot more for it. The Air Pure has less miles and significantly less performance and costs the same as the Model S LR and will not be out for another year or so.

At that point, Tesla might have single casts for all their cars fronts and backs and they might be making 4680 cells with structural packs, thereby  enabling them to match the range while bringing costs down further.

Investing in LCID is a huge gamble as frankly no one really knows what their cars are like (are they going to have numerous first-attempt issues?) and no one knows whether they can produce them at scale at a profitable cost.

He went on to say he's looking for a partnership with a car manufacturer that produces hundreds of thousands of vehicles to lease their battery tech out to.

As far as deliveries not happening already you get 1 shot at a first impression and since Lucid is making luxury vehicles its that much more important. Just wait you'll see.

For example Tesla's market cap was around $37B as recently as 2019, after they had produce hundreds of thousands of vehicles and were well into the Model 3 production ramp.

Seems like a biased double standard to me. I already invested in tesla 6 years ago but have since cashed out and invested in lucid since they're in their baby stage and have a much bigger potential for a return. 

To be clear im not saying lucid will kill tesla all im saying is they have an amazing product and is much better than fisker, nikola, ect. The CEO already said its gonna be a 2 horse race.
