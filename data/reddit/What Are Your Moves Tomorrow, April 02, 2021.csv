I've been working on side projects that help temporarily, but I really only have time to do those late at night after work. It's a mixed bag with it though... Those projects make me feel fulfilled, but they usually deeply cut into the amount of sleep I'm able to get, which I feel actually makes things worse after a while.

Point of that being, as a temporary measure, If you have something or know of something you can do for fulfillment, and you're able to do it in a healthy way, go for it. It's certainly pulled me out from some spots I shouldn't linger in too long.

Long term I'm trying to educate myself in my free time on what I enjoy doing to try and make it into something I can make some money off of down the road (currently teaching myself how to use Blender, Premeire Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop). I enjoy doing it, but I don't really have a lot of time to learn it all in an efficient way.

Anyway, in the Netherlands, you don't pay taxes on capital gains, only on the total amount of money you own (incl. stocks). That total amount tax only comes into effect when you own more than ~$35,000 ($40,000 might be more accurate considering conversion rates...) though, so if you spend the money you earn from stocks, you don't have to pay taxes on it either way.",t1_gt4aqa6,10

One of my acting coaches puts it best:

""Lifes not really a race soo much as its a marathon.""

Hell I still work a 9 to 5, then try to jam in 3 hour recording sessions *and* auditions (plus look for said auditions because im what's considered an independent actor).... Exhausting dosnt cover it, but the more work it takes to get to a point, the more you'll appreciate the end results.

I now have regular clients in Indie Dev studios. I can now call myself a ""working actor"", and I *know* now that itll continue to build as long as I remember why I started doing acting: have fun.
