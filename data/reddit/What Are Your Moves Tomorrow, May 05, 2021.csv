If so sell it ASAP and shame on you, buy a shitbox instead that costs the same as your new car because us dweebs have inflated the price but we won't yell then. You living on your own and only saving $5000 a month? You need to get a cheaper place or move back home with your tail between your legs right now. Do you have friends that like to do anything but sit around and talk about how ETFs are cool? Not anymore you don't. Dating? HA if you're lucky you'll be able to afford to go on one date once your savings rate is 99.9238% but until then you're literally STARVING yourself in the future, do you want to STARVE yourself?

Here it's like, we know you aren't saving enough to retire. No one is. Who can afford that? Fuck that, take you money and try to get rich on weeklies.

I know some wiseass will say well, ackshually we say to max out your 401k and then gamble, but whatever.

The guilt of the retirement calculator is gone. Fuck that shit and fuck my broker for making me feel bad for not saving every penny I make since I was 8 years old. Jesus, some of us need to buy food and clothes not just fund the fucking 401k.",t1_gwy3uew,11
