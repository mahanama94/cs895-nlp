From shooting up $5k instantly on the ride down like everyone else on a $2k initial deposit. To turning that $7k into $400 with an added $4.5k I had to add along the way to keep going. So with $6.5k in the game, and down to my last $400, I am now back to $7k and counting and positive on my all time chart. Thank you retards. Now I can go lose it all again",t3_gx1vt8,8
