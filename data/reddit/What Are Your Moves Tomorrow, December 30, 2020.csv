1609277793.0,2020-12-30,wallstreetbets,ghflbei,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Two more trading day for the adventure that is 2020. Despite initially opening bigly up, the indexes faded to red as the day ends. Tim Apple hits new ATH of $138.78, but closed the day red at -1.33% to $134.87. Profit taking? Market mAniPuLaTioN? MMs reducing their gamma exposure? Who the fuck knows. I'm here with you guys, not on the other side of the trade desk.

* Chinese big tech went bigly up today, with BABA going as high as over 7% during intraday and closing the day at 6.28%. PDD, its rival of sort ecommerce retailer is up 15.56% while JD closed the day up 5.49%. Hell even Luckin Coffee (LKNCY now that it's OTC) closed the day up 15.4%. The same story applies to Chinese EV ADRs as XPEV closed up 9.44%, LI up 6.15%, and NIO up 4.65% - all bouncing back from yesterday's sell-off. For once WSB catching the knife on BABA may be working out.

* Intel, the retarded boomer blue chip stock getting its ass handed to it by Su bae reversed its red day and shot up bigly midday when news broke of management being receptive to activist fund Third Point's suggestion of a ""strategic alternatives"" - whatever the fuck that means. (Divesting some prior investments and going beyond just being a chip design/manufacturer). INTC immediately went on an intraday 8% move and eventually closed the day up 4.93% at $49.39.

* The $2,000 stimulus check remains in limbo as McTurtle blocks Dems attempt to pass it via a quick unanimous vote in the Senate. The package, which will cost an additional $463 billion, is heavily frowned upon by GOP leaders. After all, deficits are a real issue when you're talking about giving money to plebs. In a weird timeline, we now have POTUS and Bernie being on the same team, putting pressure on GOPs in the Senate. 2020, eh?

* ARCT took a big -54% drill today as the market was NOT impressed with findings from trial data on its single-dose rona vax. Shares got punished and closed the day down to $42.36, a drill of more than $50 from yesterday's closing price. The biotech company was downgraded by Barclays, Baird, and Raymond James as they feel the vaccine may no longer be a viable candidate. Conversely, analysts at Piper Sandler, B. Riley Securities, and Citi thinks there are opportunity for an entry due to the big pull back and that the different mRNA vaccine can still be viable. Shares of competitor MRNA was up for the day, closing up 2.68% to $114.39.

* BA's 737 Max returns to the sky after a 2 year hiatus because well, the fucking plane was killing people. Shares of BA ended the day flat cuz shit is priced in as fuck. Though the jetliner returning to service should be an eventual boon for the likes of LUV (and other discount carriers in Asia), which relies heavily on the Max for future flights in its fleet.

* Things aren't as pretty in WSB meme stock land as PLTR continues yesterday's sell off and closed the day down another -3.78% at $24.65. If you're holding weeklies, pray to whatever jeebus you believe in. GME also retreated further, losing its $20 price point and closed the day at -7.67%, though it was down more than -9% at one point during intraday trading.

* DJI closed down -0.22%, IXIC -0.38%, SPX -0.22% and RUT took a bigger beating closing the day at -1.85%. Noteworthy numbers  and events for the rest of the week: trade goods #s at 8:30 AM ET, Chicago PMI at 9:45 AM ET, pending home sales at 10 AM ET, and EIA draw at 10:30 AM. Jobless claims will finish the week off at 8:30 on Thursday and ~~the market~~ (just bonds market) will close earlier on New Years Eve cuz why should MM fight traffic to get to their helipads for the yacht party?
