>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders",t3_ladzdt,8946

First of all, I wanna say that I am genuinely surprised how much this community can stick together. You are all incredibly entertaining and awesomely positive. Its crazy how y'all are able to lift me up even when I feel down as hell. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels a real sense of warmth and comradery every time I post here.

Over the last few days, seeing the explicit ways MM, large institutional funds, and news outlets explicitly try to hamstring through dirty plays and misinformation really demonstrates the sort of opposition we are against. It is depressing to see these large corporate have so many tools at their disposal to undermine any concerted efforts to call out their bullshit.

As much as America likes to claim that this is a land of opportunity, anyone can see that opportunities to progress ones financial independence has been getting more and more scarce as the years go by.

I know everyone else here feels it too, I don't think I've ever seen this much rage concentrated at wallstreet before. I can literally feel the palpable tension over how badly people here want to see institutional change and create a system that rewards financial growth over wealth monopolization which has been completely absent in our generation.

1612213743.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glnemu7,"##1. Remind everyone that these short attacks are in part to find your stop losses and snipe them.

##2. Remind everyone that today's low close will be fed to the news media to manipulate sentiment - expect headlines and coverage saying ""we told you so, get out while you still can""; ""the squeeze is over""; ""the hedges have covered"" etc. This is *designed* to trigger a fear response in your brain.

##3. Remind everyone to stop using robinhood

##4. Remind everyone to buy when they can - the more real shares we lock up and hold, the fewer they have to buy and cover.

##5. Remind everyone that even if they ladder this down to fucking $5 and start buying to cover the SP will, by definition, have to rise. They can't buy what they need to cover from each other, the math just doesn't work out.

##6. Remind everyone there is a very good chance they were using fake shares in these short positions adding to the blatantly illegal activity we've seen thus far. There is legitimate DD on this possibility that's been posted here and on actual investing subreddits.

1612214186.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glnfsq2,"**Summary**

As soon as the market opened, Melvin Cuntiple & Co did a short ladder attack, this worked in lowering the price of GME to $213 but it did not increase the volume of shares being sold.

2 hours after opening the price of GME went up $276, clearly the short ladder attack did not work!

After that the price slowly went down slowly to $225 at close.

**Why did this happen**

Despite the share price falling slowly over the day, it is not something to worry about because volume of shares traded averages out to 100 per share. Since these are exact shares we know they're still trying to do their ladder attack but over a slightly longer period of time. You can check the volume of shares traded [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades). The main point is since shares are sold in either 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 quantities we know it's a ladder attack.

We also saw CNBC state that redditors had moved over to silver. That is FAKE NEWS, this is one of their last dirty tricks against us APES but it's not working. They're currently shitting themselves too.

**Why didn't the price of GME go to the moon yet?**

There are two reasons for this.

Firstly, some brokers like RobinDaHood placed limits on how much GME you could order whereas other brokers like Trading 212 and Etoro just crashed all day. (Make sure you clear any stop losses at 20% because these cunts won't stop at anything to make sure lose.

Secondly, it seems like a lot of fellow APES are switching over to Fidelity and it can take a few days for funds to get accepted into the account, or something like that. I'm sure someone in the comments will know the exact answer. Anyway, these delay of funds has essentially slowed the buying. So once accounts get cleared which should be by Thursday I believe, we should start to see the price rise past $400 quite quickly.

**Our Gameplan**

So those hedge fuckers know once people's accounts get accepted on Fidelity etc that they're fucked. They will try every trick in the book until Thursday or whenever APES can start buying again.

Our gameplay is very simple APES

Just keep HOLDING

Play some video games, watch some videos of bankers crying idk but just keep HOLDING

In a few days more APES will buy GME and the price will start to increase quite quickly

**TLDR**

JUST KEEP HOLDING AND APES GO MOON WHEN MORE APES BUY GME 🚀🌓",t3_ladzdt,1540

1612218193.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glnpjrj,"So, let’s just rewind a few days. Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don’t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what’s necessary and finally get ours. We’ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It’s time for change.

GME & AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.

Were people expecting the price to literally just go up every single day until a squeeze happened? This has never occurred in the history of any short squeeze ever.

The price drop on low volume just confirms that people are holding, which is exactly the best case scenario for a squeeze.

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.


Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

1612218833.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glnr4au," 

So, let’s just rewind a few days. Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don’t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what’s necessary and finally get ours. We’ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It’s time for change.

GME & AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.

1612218501.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glnqan1,"So, let’s just rewind a few days. Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don’t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what’s necessary and finally get ours. We’ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It’s time for change.

GME & AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.

LETS DO THIS!!! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.",t3_ladzdt,77

I am not a financial advisor just your average idiot. This is my first time on reddit but I have been investing for about eight years or so. There is so much noob negativity and bot bullshit flying around this subreddit. Spend a few hours researching and doing a deep dive on this movement you will easily understand. First thing you need to know is HOLD. We have all the power here. The hedgefund assholes are losing money everyday. They know they are fucked and are doing everything in their power to stop us. They are trying to scare us with short ladder attacks and the corrupt main stream media. I know the noobs reading this are concerned about the payout but this thing is much bigger than that. If you dedicate yourself to the cause and ride this thing through, ya you might make a pretty penny. At this point it has become a revolution. The student has become the master. Us youngins are ready to show these baby boomers that we are ready to take control of this goddamm corrupt world. The passing of the baton is now. Buy the fucking dips and hold on for dear life. Apes strong together. Send this thing to the fucking moon and beyond.

Right now you may be up thousands of dollars, or you may so red you feel sick. Remember that your only option is to sell and when you do that, you either lose your money or you lose out on the money that will come with the squeeze - a squeeze that is destined to happen. At 220, at 340, at 550, these shares are not a price but a ticket to the moon, it has to go up.

The shorts are failing, their ladder attacks are not working and can only go on for so long. You are not alone, people on here have bought in with millions at a high price and are sitting pretty through all of this, they will not sell either.

Now. Think about what is going on throughout this. Calls are being made, people are running around, stress is rife throughout Wall St. What did you do today? Did you get high, play video games, jerk off to hentai? Imagine being at one of these firms knowing that the people jacking off to hentai are costing you billions as you do it.

Now think about the money. Do you really need that money right at this very moment. Its going to go down, its going to go up, but it'll take a while to go to the moon. So chill, it's something you likely have no direct control over outside of holding or buying. You can sit and be happy whilst this plays out.

If it's all getting to you, don't check the price constantly, restrict how much you watch the news, read the reddit. Set alarms, set alerts, set yourself up to be happy.

Good luck, get tendies, hold.",t3_ladzdt,214
1612217711.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glnoehi,"Before I head to bed I feel the need to leave behind three important pieces of information behind for tomorrow. 

##The first one is this:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

##The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

##The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.
​
Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

We can do this.

To all the small stock owners. You matter too.❤️Collectively, we have managed to take half of these suit’s money. I have no doubt in my mind we can get out ahead. Think about the number, BILLIONS!!! 20 BILLION!!! It’ll get spread across us all like my mothers sweet cheeks. It will happen.

1612221790.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glny2nb,"Here’s some unsolicited advice from an old salty sea dog like myself. For all the 🧻🙌 newbies who are tempted to sell right now. 

1. Fucking DONT. It’s simple, if you sell right now you give leverage to the hedges. You give them actual shares to work with. These dips are artificial and are caused by hedge funds trading the same shorted securities back and forth for Lowe and and lower prices. These idiots are playing the game with Disney-bucks. We have leverage now. 

2. Fuck THEM. Seriously, fuck these guys. They are the same cocksuckers that bent you and the rest of the world over a barrel in 2008 and again during the peak chaos of COVID. These motherfuckers made TRILLIONS, with a **T** while you got $1800 over a year at best. 

3. Fucking CHILL. This is not the end of the world. You have a **STOCK** not an **OPTION** it is literally impossible for you to lose money unless you sell for less than you bought for. This entire process can last for days, weeks, or months. If you bought in for $300 and it drops down to $200, buy more, you will **average down**. You could average all the way down to tree fiddy per share and sell for  $4.20 and *you will still profit*. 

There is no expiration to these shares as long as GME remains a company. Ride it out, make a profit, and tell the suits to get fucked. 

This is not financial advice. It’s an invitation for the SEC to take Wall St.’s dick out of their mouth and slob on my hog instead.

I've been trying to get my long AMC DD up for a few days but it appears that account age and karma aren't the issue as I've tried to get some friends to post on my behalf

(some of them even posting a DD in the sub as recent as 3 days ago)

But automod keeps declining my post (even as recent as right now) without letting me know a reason. The DD is 4 pages long with 23 hyperlinks to outside sources so maybe that might have something to do with it?

You can preview the DD [here](https://pdfhost.io/v/ItmSOLZXO_In_Theaters_Near_You_An_InDepth_AMC_Analysis_Response_to_CNBC.pdf) and check out the comment thread I made on the daily post [regarding this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la75n9/daily_discussion_thread_2_for_february_1_2021/glmeayd/?context=3)

Sorry for the spam, I've just been trying to get a mod's attention regarding this issue but it's a lot harder than I thought and I think for the sake of paper-handers that this research should be read ASAP.  


PLEASE UPVOTE THIS IF YOU HOLD AMC, and also check out my research on it. ESPECIALLY if you're feeling paper-handy.
