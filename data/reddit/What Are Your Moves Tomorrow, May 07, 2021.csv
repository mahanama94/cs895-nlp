And all through the chats,

The üåàüêª were spamming,

Like spoiled little brats.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Wallstreetbets was strong,

And the bulls didn‚Äôt care,

Futes are green they said,

Bad time to be a bear.

‚Äî‚Äî-

So we all went to bed,

Wife‚Äôs BF tucked us in,

We closed our eyes,

And the mind began to spin.

‚Äî‚Äî

At first we saw stocks,

All red on the docket,

Then everything shifted,

Now we see rockets!

‚Äî‚Äî

The dreaming continued,

Just until when,

My phone went off,

Frick, I slept in!

‚Äî‚Äî

I boot up the broker,

To check my FDs,

When an unfamiliar sight,

Makes me freeze...

‚Äî‚Äî

My phone is green,

Up 200 percent!

I‚Äôm no longer broke,

I can pay my rent!

‚Äî‚Äî

I slowly smile,

It‚Äôs just my luck,

I mutter quietly,

1620358993.0,2021-05-07,wallstreetbets,gx8gqni,"As the market starts to revalue itself going post COVID, a good thought excersise is

Is that growth/meme stock that's down 40% a value buy rn or is that just a greedy justification? Growth stocks rise parabolically in a bull environment but can also drop parabolically in a bear one. Just because a stock drops a large percentage doesn't mean that it will bounce back to what it was back then.

The market punishes those with a fixed mindset

One thing I like to do when repricing for the sake of simplicity is to revalue my expectations by a certain percentage.

If growth stocks hit $100 ATH in bull market, but the market doesn't reward growth stocks anymore due to macro factors, then I will take x percentage and multiple that by ATH to get a new readjusted ATH high.

Say the growth stock is rewarded 30% less in this new market, which means going forward, $100 * 70% = $70. I would treat this as the new relative ATH that the stock hit and that $100 price doesn't exist anymore. Erase that from your history 

Now adjust what the price is right now as a percentage of that new ATH and see if it's still worth investing or if theres still room to drop.


Current price of stock = $60.  
Old percentage lost = $100 -> $60 = -40% @ $100 ATH  
Readjust percentage lost = $70 - $60 = -14% @ $ 70 ATH*

From this, 14% drop seems like there is still room for it to drop for a market where SPY is at ATH. Risk to reward is not on your side.
