HALTS- they happen every day on plenty of stocks that have high volatility and price spikes. It’s normal so don’t let it scare you. Halts usually last for 5 min sometimes longer so keep an eye on what happens next. Selling because of halts can screw you out of massive gains. 

ROBINHOOD- doesn’t choose when to halt trading. The SEC/NASDAQ does that. RH can restrict trading like they did in January but they CANNOT halt trading. 

DIPS- don’t freak tf out if GME dips $20 pre market. That is not significant. Especially when we opened yesterday at $44. So calm down plz. 

Hope this helps you make smarter decisions on our way to the moon. Cheers and have fun 🥂",t3_ls42x6,302
