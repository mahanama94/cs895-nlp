1621333851.0,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,gyjx4gl,"Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the way. Nasdaq up about 0.75%. S&P 500 and Dow about 0.3% to the good. That’s as of 0620.

This follows a day of modest losses on Wall Street. Losses narrowed into the close and apparently that has kept up overnight.

On the economic data front today, we have housing starts and building permits for April, out at 0830. Estimates call for 1.75 million new permits, roughly in line with March. The question is if we beat February’s 15-year high of 1.89 million. 

You don’t need me to tell you that this will bring more talk of inflation. That could hurt tech. I’ve been active in tech shares but you’ll have to listen to the audio to get that information.

1621342645.0,2021-05-18,wallstreetbets,gykaq7c,"Despite high demand housing starts fell super heavy. Massively increased materials prices created shortages that have boosted prices to levels that are now stymying the construction industry. Calls on home prices? 
Lumber futures have fallen over 25% in the past week. Is this the legendary cyclical demand glut fizzling while the available supply surges? 
Possibly, but not likely. It’s more likely that people aren’t starting new projects and haven n’t been for awhile. In progress projects will pay those high prices because you end up losing money when half built stuff sits. Most summer seasons are bad for building material demand anyway, which is probably only exacerbating the drop.  I’m not bold enough to put a price on where lumber futures will stabilize, but for the sake of my calls I’m going to say. “Soon”. Lumber companies are making bank when the price is above 400, let alone 1700. Many will find profit margins take a significant hit when it does fall to 400 though, the extra capacity lines they bring on during periods of high demand have higher marginal costs. 

I’m still wagering these companies are fairly undervalued due to the overall high sustained demand for more housing in suburban and rural areas, especially considering supply conditions in general, and I believe the shift to remote work, and the houses people will want, is going to keep demand higher than expected for several years. 

I’m also hoping it solves gentrification in cities, but I mean hey. I’ll just keep buying calls.",t3_nf6oeg,8
