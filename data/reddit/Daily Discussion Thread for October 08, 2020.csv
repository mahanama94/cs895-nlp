1602163338.0,2020-10-08,wallstreetbets,g83tkmw,"Researchers occasionally poll Americans about what they think the distribution of wealth and income is in the US.

We're so dumb we think that the bottom 20% have ~3% of the wealth, and the top 20% only have 59%. Reality is the bottom ***40%*** own basically fuck-all, and the top 20% own ~84%. And that data is from 2014 so shit has only gotten more unbalanced (thanks, JPow!).

Edit: We're also terrible at guessing where we are in the wealth and income distributions. Everyone but the insanely rich think they're in the middle third. Nobody admits they're poor and lawyers pulling in $600k/year think they're average.",t1_g83sowq,19
