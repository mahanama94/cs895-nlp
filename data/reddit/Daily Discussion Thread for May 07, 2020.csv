As an investor, you have two choices, put your money into bonds that yield no return, or put your money in overvalued stocks that will at least outperform inflation.  Everyone here keeps asking why stocks keep going up well here is your answer. However, Buffet is not buying stocks even if interest rates are at zero because he knows the fed will raise interest rates whenever inflation returns because the fed has targeted 2% inflation. So if you buy stocks when interest rates are 0% and rates return to 4% the value of your stocks will drop because people will exit from stocks and be more willing to go back into bonds.",t3_gf3vim,16
