They promised better pricing and features.  They skipped over details like specification price points, and that deliveries aren't expected to start for a year (Spring '22 = as late as May).  

Specifications/option packages won't be defined by Ford until Fall (surely timed to undermine LMC final specs), and they will surely make the $90k models first.  It's also very easy to juice preorder numbers when you tell dealers to use the preorder website to reserve their stock.

IMO the Ford event was meant to advertise to fleet owners that they can wait a year or two on their EV upgrades, instead of signing up with LTM.

Microvision is not a fraud and has built an Intellectual Property Portfolio consisting of decades worth of patents formulating economic moats around laser scanning technology.

The sector is saturated but it’s not hard to sift through bullshit and pick winners. Difference is some stocks get shorted as the market corrects the value of crap companies, while some stocks get shorted to enable the whales to have a cheaper entry.

I wanted to post here for a few times about RIDE but got rejected by bots. I hope more people can look into this Tesla2.0 .

The sales of Pickup truck in Q4 2020 surpassed Sedans for the first time in US. EV Pickup truck is the future warzone of EV, not supercars, not low cost EVs for your grandma.

Ford spent millions of PR fund on the unveal of F150 Lightning and invited the president to test drive. You can consider it as a candidate of Democrats.

Endurance also got the blessings of GOP. Donald Trump and Pence help promoted Endurance of RIDE while they are still leading the country back to prosperity.

No matter how the county's economy grow under Biden's adminstration, EV Pickup trucks will still be a focus of the country. Fleets especially need a lower running cost and maintenance cost during economy recovery so that they can run their business more efficiently than their competitors. And if economy goes down because of Biden' administration, fleet managers will also need a lower running cost more than before.

And if you look at the ICE Full Size Pickup trucks market, you can see that even the worst performing Full Size pickup trucks as rated by Consumer Reports, they still got tens of thousands of purchases in 2020.
https://www.motorbiscuit.com/2020-pickup-trucks-these-are-the-worst-of-the-year/

According to the current information, RIDE will be the ONLY Full Size EV Pickup Truck on market from Sept 2021 - Q2 2022, which gives it 6-9 months of leading time ahead of Ford F150 Lightning.

RIDE may not be the BEST of the BEST Full Size EV pickup truck in the world, but its Hub Motors Innovation, the bravery and courage of changing the status quo and challenging the giants is the reason for me to invest in this company.",t3_njgs1i,8

Another concern for longer term stakes in the company is there is a buttload of bag holders between 8 bucks to 30 bucks in the stock. To get enough momentum to get it back up and keep it up it's gonna need a big dose of the blue pill. Lotta investors are gonna be happy to bail as soon as they get close to lifting bags and keep the price down.

Been following for 2 months or so and got tempted for 1400 shares at slightly above 11 average.   
Thing is, it went lower than I ever though possible and I have been waiting for the squeeze ever since. Those 3-4 days it went up 70% felt great, but it came back down pretty quick and 8s are now, not far-fetched.   
I think a ""real squeeze"" will only happen when a substantial milestone is achieved and is advertised effectively. Spread far and wide. Word gets out.

Assuming 2 months of beta testing puts us roughly at today, there's no way 3-4 months from now they have incorporated any significant feedback...if there are any major design changes required, it will push their timeline out months.

ApprehensiveBee4199 - I’m in. Lordstown Motors 🚀🚀🚀🚀

EveningMind5809 - I’m long on this company I believe they have great long term potential. I also agree with OP this is primed for a short squeeze. I think there’s many folks shorting them that don’t know the real potential and what positive news could result in. Many just read Hindenburgs report and took it at face value.


PureSatisfaction4670 - Let’s go!!! Fingers crossed for moon news Monday!!!


Past-Olive-8732 - The shorts have laid out all their cards and LTM is knocking them down 1 by 1. Shorts will hit them for cash burn as if it’s not expected. But they drove this down so much that it doesn’t make sense. LTM just has to start delivering vehicles this year and it’s SP is going up 3x or more

It needs to capture market share, it doesn't need to capture the whole fucking market. if it only sells 200k trucks to Ford's 600k the only one who would consider that a failure would be you and the shorts. As for production, the plant was producing 600k Cruzes at its peak. And that's a vehicle with a full drive train, exhaust, fuel system etc.  The Endurance has about 1/4 of that to install. 

As for pricing.  Ford. Fucking. Lied.  The truck *starts* at 39.9k.  That's without the extended range package, the towing package, and all the little extras that you would need to pay for to get a vehicle with comparable specs to the Endurance.  And that's if you could find a base model Lightning for sale.  According to Ford, the F150 LT starts at 28.9k.  Know anyone who paid less than 40k for a new F150?  Fuck, when I tried to order one with base specs, it quoted me a price of 35k.  Im sure somewhere there's a 2021 F150 selling for under 30k.  But it aint to you, me or damn near anyone who isn't in on that scam.

As for the bagholders being between 8-30.  That's a hell of a fucking spread buddy.  If it hits 30 over the next two weeks, that's a 200% gain. Sure it isn't GameStop, but honestly, what is out there?

Seems people only look at bad news and report on it, there's more good than bad:

The good:

- Betas on track

- Production still expected in Sept. 

- 5 Star crash ratings expected

- Working on Van

- Not chip constrained this year

- Brought Frame in house (Cost $$ now, saves in future)

- Brought Batteries in house (Cost $$ now, saves in future)

- Converting pre-orders to purchase agreements (@23k) 


Did any news outlet report on that? No... they reported on --> 

The Bad:

- COVID put strain on supply chain, they needed to spend more for parts (and brought some aspects in house to save in the future)

- Need more funding to meet 2021 production goals of 2200; without funding ~1000. 


But, most reports didn't actually explain why they needed more money nor that the production goal cut by 50% was only if they didn't secure more funding. 

All the bad are within reason for a new company, and the only real downside is if they cannot secure additional funding to meet their goals. They seemed to have no doubt they would be able to secure the funding; while ATVM  is a plus, it's not their only funding option.",t1_gzelhau,2

LMC is in a totally different place. Low overhead and going after a specific market segment. They have a solid plan, but they must execute and sell quality trucks to get a foothold.
