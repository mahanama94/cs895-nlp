1608066999.0,2020-12-16,wallstreetbets,gfyolrm,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:


* AAPL aims for upping production on their flagship iPhone by 30% for 1st half of 2021 (based on #s from supliers) while JPMorgan sees 20% upside for them in 2021. Tim Apple gaps up and opens at 2%+ this morning with shares going as high as 4.52% intraday. The stock closed at $127.88, up a beefy 5%, level unseen since earlier this September.
* Meanwhile, the rest of big tech took an initial mini dump this morning while the indexes are solidly green cuz sEcToR roTAtiOn and stimulus hOpE but reversed to close mostly green (except for MSFT cuz hur dur MSFT $200c).
* Earlier today, Pelosi asked for McConnell, Schumer, and McCarthy to a 4pm meeting, while current Congressional plan calls for splitting the $948 billion bill into two parts, a $748b in spending programs that are popular for both parties and the 2nd $160b bill with liability protection and aid to state plus local govt. Stimulus checks are STILL not in current plans (rofl). But don't worry, that public ""small business"" with a few thousand employees (not in same location) will no doubt be able to easily access forgivable PPP loans in the coming weeks!
* Cramer talked about WSB today via a segment on TheStreet and WSB proceed to jizz over itself uncontrollably because one old bald dude talking mildly positive about WSB is *just* like the opposite sex touching our genital. This is what #WINNING in 2020 looks like, bois.
* Chinese EV ADR/ADS jump bigly today thanks to who the fuck knows why, with XPEV at intraday high of 7.82%, NIO at 6.1%, LI at almost 5%, and KN-DI at 3%. The EV meme stocks all closed in positive territory despite pulling back from initial highs.
* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR pulled back 2.97%, continuing in current channel while WSB triples down because ThIS iS a $50 sToNk. DBX, a new play by select WSBer ended the day red but don't worry, an acquisition news is just around the corner before your 12/18s expire worthless. Finally, GME is up 8.88%, likely buoyant by today's NPD report showing 35% increase in YoY November gaming spending thanks to the new gen console cycle release.
* The Dow closed up more than 338 pts to 1.13%, Nasdaq up 155 pts to 1.25%, and S&P up 47 pts to 1.29%. Will stimulus arrive? As Pelosi said by EOD: ""We'll see.""
* Tons of market moving events tomorrow: 8:30 AM retail sales, 9:45 AM PMI, business inventories and housing market index at 10:00 AM, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and finally Jpow speaks tomorrow at 2:30 PM ET after FOMC release at 2:00 PM. Jpow can be as dovish as he wants but without stimulus this market likely has only so much more leg to go in the near term.",t3_kdue98,278

Pelosi has said that she would be willing to settle on the bipartisan bill presented yesterday and can guarantee 95% of house dems voting for it if they will include $1200 checks for all Americans.

McConnell is still iffy on $1200 payments.  Both house and senate whips are currently trying to count votes.  The newest sticking point that is coming out of today is trump (via mnuchin) saying that he will veto any bill that does not include a repeal of section 230.  Mnuchin and Trump literally do not care how much or how little the stimulus package is but the expectation is that there is either a repeal of section 230 and/or the senate agrees to a special counsel to investigate hunter biden if they want to have POTUS on board.

I resigned yesterday from a high ranking position in my company because I was tired of senior management's indifference toward issues plaguing my department.  We are all extremely unhappy.  For myself, I controlled about 5% of the business' total assets.  So not a massive role, but not a small role.  I was considered to be a rising star, having been promoted multiple times including being one of the youngest VP's in the company.  There have been a number of notable resignations lately from older employees including nearly a clean sweep of the C-Suite but I'm the first among my general cohort.

Neither the President nor the director of my department have called since I resigned.  

I have to say my feelings are hurt a little.  I knew they didn't give a shit but I thought they'd at least act like they did.

On to better things I guess.",t3_kdue98,14

Fear from some congressional staffers that any ""bipartisan"" solution that comes up to a vote this week will not have a big enough majority that could overcome Trump veto. Fringe senate/house reps (too much $$ on the right and not enough $$ on the left) are what's left to convince.  POTUS still set on repealing section 230 despite not getting it through via defense spending bill. Doesn't care if it's tied to omnibus or covid Relief bill but he's set on vetoing any $$

Edit: you can choose to believe me or not but my source is a congressional staffer (they're based out of where I live so not a DC staffer but has been in DC for last month) who is a close friend that I work with regularly in my daytime job.
