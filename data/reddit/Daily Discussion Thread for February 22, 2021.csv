Right now we’re in the middle of a market pull back.

If your not able to ride out the next week or two, then maybe this shit isn’t for you.

The idea that you can consistently make 100% gains every single day is just not realistic for the majority.

If you believe in the positions you have right now, hold them! Check back in 2 weeks and see how your doing.

It’s true that stonks only go up, just not every single day!

Relax, get on with your daily life, and be positive about the fact that you actually have a position in the market.

A lot of people go their entire life without investing/saving a single penny, your one of the lucky ones. Goodnight ✌️",t3_lplby9,43

1614002936.0,2021-02-22,wallstreetbets,gocaect,"The year is 2024. I throw on my mammoth-hide coat and step out of my Texas home. Ever since the US rejoined the Paris Climate Accord and defeated global warming in 2021, the average temperature in Texas has been around 68 degrees...Kelvin. I stretch my legs and then a Lucid car catches my attention. Not a real car, just a billboard concept art; Lucid doesn't actually have a product. I know its going to be a long walk into work today. I'm walking, of course, because all gas powered vehicles have been banned, and even though I was part of the legendary +1,000,000% $PLTR run-up from the start, I still lost out to the 1,000,050% inflation in the USD and can't afford a Tesla. I was riding the hyperloop into work for a while, but we had an extremely minor earthquake a while back that caused the entire tube to explode in a blast comparable to Hiroshima. I work, obviously, for Amazon as everyone does. Of course, since no one can afford products any more, Amazon's business model has changed a bit. Now, they just receive government contracts to pay us to load and unload the same goods onto the same trucks over and over all day. It keeps the unemployment numbers down, which is good for the economy. I open my Robinhood app and see that they have raised the number of stocks retail investors can buy to 3 today.
