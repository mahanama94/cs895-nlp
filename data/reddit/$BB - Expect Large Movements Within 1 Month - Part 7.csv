1623259836.0,2021-01-17,wallstreetbets,h16eivl,"One call is a contract to buy 100 shares for a specific price at a specific date. Calls are used when you predict a stock will increase in price, Puts are used when you predict it will fall

For example, say I bought 10 calls of BB for $12 for 6/18. That means that on 6/18, I reserve the right to buy 1000 shares of BB for $12 each. The catch is that you're charged a premium per share to reserve this contract. So if the premium costs $1 for this call, I'd have to pay $1000 in premium to hold this contract.

Then you have 3 options. 1) on 6/18 you can execute the call and purchase 1000 shares of BB for $12 each, having already paid your premium. 2) You can sell the contract to someone else, but that's only going to happen if the stock goes up. 3) Let the call expire, meaning that you don't actually buy 1000 shares for $12 each (handy if the stock price falls), but you still lose the premium you already paid. 

Definitely a lot more risky than just buying and selling stocks, but with the potential for a lot more profit",t1_h15o8b9,10
