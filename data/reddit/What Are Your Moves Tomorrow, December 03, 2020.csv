1606957033.0,2020-12-03,wallstreetbets,gefs537,"Gather round retards. Storytime. 

The very first stock trade I ever made was a small biotech company called AEMD. This was in 2014 during the huge Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Stocks like LAKE, APT, and TKMR were going absolutely crazy. So being the young autist I was I searched for the next meme stock to go parabolic. And I found it. AEMD. A cheap penny stock trading on the pink sheets.

AEMD had this device called the Hemopurifier. Supposedly it filtered out the Ebola virus from the blood and increased the chance the patient would recover. We all know how lethal Ebola is with a death rate of 90%. 

So I found out they were testing it on an Ebola patient in Germany. I figured if he lived the stock price would see an insane jump. 

I was young and broke but I took every last cent I had and even took out a few small loans and threw $10k into it. This was on a Friday.  

Come Tuesday the following week, AEMD issued a press release: the patient survived! The device worked! The stock price tripled. I made $20k in a few days. I was on top of the world. I was going to hold this stock forever and retire early.

I then watched as the stock came falling all the way back down in the next couple of days. Poof. All my profits were gone. 

The End.",t3_k5ifwd,51

But in the moment... every minor blip in a trend looks like the start of a turn around that's about to take all your profits. The price is at the moving average... is that the perfect dip buying opportunity or is it your last chance to sell before things really go south? You've just climbed your way back to break-even... will this next dip give way to a higher high and finally some profits or will it take you to a lowerer low and guarantee you don't recover for the day. Should you sell everything and take profits? Should you buy the dip? Should you hedge? What strike should you pick? What expiration is best?

A thousand decisions a day. Every moment where you don't make a decision is a decision to stay the course. Your decisions, discipline, strategy, and conviction all come together every day. When they're working together with the market it's the best feeling in the world. When every decision you make is the wrong one, you want to give up and throw in the towel.

If today was a good day, congratulations and don't get cocky. If today was a bad day, I'm sorry... Keep cool and don't chase the losses with increasingly reckless decisions; lower the size of your bets so you can rebuild. Tomorrow we do this again. Chicken tendies await.
