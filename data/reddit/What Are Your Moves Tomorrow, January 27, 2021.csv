Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are $208 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

To the moon my dear retards!

Just to be clear. I do not respect the sec, CNBC, or hedge funds. These fucking assholes have had a stock market monopoly for years telling boomers to trust them to invest their money because it’s “too complicated” to invest.

Boomers were ok with that because they were plundering the economy and fucking over gen X, millennials and zoomers.

Along comes robinhood and makes trading accessible, and zoomers and millennials jump into the markets because we know we’re fucked unless we go out and make our own retirements.

Now the monopoly is whining because they’re getting fucked at their own shitty game. They don’t understand that we’re not doing it for a 5th fucking vacation house, we’re doing it to have something when we’re old because them and the boomers already looted our financial futures.

So fuck hedge funds. Fuck CNBC and these idiot financial channels. And especially fuck the SEC who didn’t give a shit while the rich raided the cookie jar and blatantly insider traded for years up to this point.

I hope each and every one of y’all makes money on just the absolute stupidest shit just to spite these pieces of shit. Happy short hunting",t3_l5nizs,121

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

Right now gme is in a great situation to make money.  If you're here to ask if its too late, the answer is no.  Its not too late.  Short reports come out tomorrow.  270 is a strong target price that seems realistic to apply pressure to short positions.  Strike prices have been met so a gamma squeeze it likely.  Understand that if you buy you need to hold.  We are taking a rocket to the moon.  Making history. The greatest short squeeze in history.  Just buy gme and hold.  That is all.  You dont need to know about options right now.  The play is simple.  Buy gme and hold.  No the squeeze hasn't happened yet.  No it is not too late.  Just buy shares of gme and hold.

1611723848.0,2021-01-27,wallstreetbets,gkwxzyx,"Alright ya filthy animals. I’m here to help you figure out how to play GME tomorrow.

1.	**Shares**

Buy em, hold em, **don’t sell em**. It’s going to be a bumpy ride and most of ya rookies don’t got the testicular fortitude for seeing wild swings in your portfolio. Shares mitigate that. The next part is of the utmost importance. **YOU PUT A LIMIT ORDER IN FOR YOUR SHARES**. Why? Because unbeknownst to you, your broker will loan these for ridiculous fees of which you get nothing (as high as 84% today). Willing to bet most of you paste eaters had no idea about this. Yep, the game is rigged against you. But they can’t loan them if you’re trying to sell them. Just put whatever price in you want ($1,000 or $420.69). This is moot if you’ve been shares cash only.

2.	**Weekly calls**

Buy a call that’s 1 or 2 strikes OTM from the current stock price. Why? Because a large MM just sold you that call. Your broker sells your order flow to MM’s so they can make money. The game is rigged against you. To offset his risk the MM will then go buy an amount of shares corresponding to the option delta. 0.80 Delta = MM buys 80 shares. The closer your option is to the strike price, the more MM has to buy in the market. This is a basic understanding of the term Gamma Squeeze you just heard about yesterday.

3.	**Multi-leg approach**

>Sell a cash secured put 1-2 strikes OTM

>Use the money you got from selling the put to buy a call 1-2 OTM

Now the MM will buy shares to cover both the call and put. Double the gamma. Double the fun.

And just remember. **WE LIKE THE STOCK**. We did not short this stock. We buy this stock because we know its undervalued. We believe in using our money to power good companies in a free market economy. We did everything right in the market. They played stupid games and won stupid prizes. We go to the moon.

You autists on this sub would go balls deep and emerge bathing in gains thick enough to suffocate a man. I grew envious and FOMO ate away at me. I honestly didn’t think GME would go anywhere. I listened to people who called it overvalued. I watched as it climbed from $12 to $60 to 150. After it crashed to 75 yesterday, I took out and withdrawal and threw it into GME. Fuck it. Yolo, right? I mean, if I wanted to make some stacks, I had to embrace the brainless mindset you guys had 

Went to bed. Slept in rather late and woke up to 100% gains. After hours hit and we saw $200. It honestly feels like a dream and I don’t want it to end. It feels insanely illegal as to how ridiculously easy this was. I made more overnight than a week of work. You guys are all over the news, and now apparently daddy Elon is tweeting about us.

the shorts *are* covering and then new shorts are taking their place at higher prices. eventually they are going to be right. someone is going to short it at the top whatever the top is and make a lot of money when it falls. I don't care if that top is 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000 a share eventually there will be a top of the squeeze and somebody wants to short the top. it can't go up for all infinity and it will continue to have short interest all the way up because all the shorts think that it's an overvalued company. so it's going to have short interest literally the whole time therefore short interest is not an indication of how far along the squeeze is. it's just that now we have people who are short at 200 instead of short at 40 bucks.",t1_gkvchoi,32
