1607634617.0,2020-12-11,wallstreetbets,gfbnf21,"Reeeeeeeecap of market driving news today:

* AirBNB IPO'ed today with opening transaction at $146/$150, far higher than the offer price of $68. The stock went as high as $165 before trading between $142 and $149 for the rest of the day and closed at $144, up 112% from offering price. Somewhere out there, a WSBer fomo into ABNB at $164. This is the way.

* Initial weekly jobless claims jumped again to 853k, topping the estimates of 730k, while this is the highest # of claim since Sep, the trendline has been pretty consistent in new initial weekly claims hovering within the 700-800k. This is a jump from last week's 716k.

* McTurtle once again rejects bipartisan plan on stimulus. Senate GOP likely wouldn't support the $908 bil plan if they try to tie state + local with liability. Meanwhile, Dems are worried w/o state and local funding first responders and teachers will have to be let go due to budget/revenue constraint from shutting things down half-assed.

* Congress is planning to pass a 1-week govt funding extension thru Dec 18 to buy more time. If they couldnt get the 2nd round of stimulus passed since May, surely they will make it happen now. As of writing, about 12 mil Americans are still out of work and relies on soon to be expired extended UI benefits (without additional federal bonus).

* Snap launches Twitter integration via a partnership. SNAP shares up 7%+ today. TWTR up 8%+. Likely a move to bolster themselves against Instagram/Facebook and pouring extra salt on Zuck's antitrust saga.

* TSLA and Elon chan continues their unabated mission to Mars, with the EV meme stock recovering from a red opening low of $566 to closing at around $627, up 3.7% for the day. The memetastic EV and solar power provider is rumored to be securing Cybertruck steel from a new 1.7b factory in TX. They've also recently initiated a new offering of up to 5 bil worth of stocks, which has not deterred retail and funds appetite. Shares are up 51% for the month and 643% for the year.

*  Unsurprisingly, POTUS tweeted about the DOW at ATH earlier this week which prompted the first red day in awhile. S&P and Dow (the most retarded index ever) closed red for another day this week, while Chadsdaq and small caps (fuck small caps) closed green at .54% and 1.07%.

1607661450.0,2020-12-11,wallstreetbets,gfd01gq,"In March 1999, Priceline went public at $16 a share. On its first day of trading went up to $88, before settling at $69. This gave Priceline a market capitalization of $9.8 billion, the largest first-day valuation of an internet company to that date. Few investors were concerned that in its first few quarters in business Priceline racked up losses of $142.5 million. Or that it had to buy tickets on the open market ‚Äî at cost ‚Äî to fulfill customers‚Äô lowball bids, losing, on average, $30 on every ticket it sold. Or that Priceline customers often ended up paying¬†more¬†at auction than they could have paid through a traditional travel agent. Investors were more interested in grabbing a piece of a company that was going to change the future of business.

Sounds familiar? Its almost like WSB existed then.

""Several days later, he sent a letter to Rome with measures to alleviate the crisis. The decrees which had precipitated the problem were suspended.¬†100 million sesterces were to be taken from the imperial treasury and distributed among reliable bankers, to be loaned to the neediest debtors.¬† (A loaf of bread sold for half a sestertius and soldiers earned around 1000 sesterces, so if you take an average soldier‚Äôs salary of around $20,000, you could say that one sestertius was equal to about $20 today.) The 100 million sesterces was equivalent to around $2 billion.
No interest was to be collected for three years; but security was to be offered at double value in real property.¬†¬†This enabled many people to avoid selling their estates at low prices, stopping the fall in prices and ensuring that the lack of liquidity never occurred.¬†Though a few banks never recovered from the panic, most continued business as usual, and the financial panic ended as quickly as it began.
