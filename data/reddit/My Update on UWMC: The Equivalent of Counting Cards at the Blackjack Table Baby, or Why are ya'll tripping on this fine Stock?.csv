1618297429.0,2019-12-29,wallstreetbets,guchd47,"I'm gonna be honest. I read the first paragraph, saw how long the post was and said nah fuck that. I'm glad DD is being put out on the company though.


I'd like to contribute by voicing my experience having UWMC underwrite my loan. I live in an area where selling your house at the listed price means you fucked up. Since buying my house in july its 'value' (according to redfin, take it with a grain of salt) has gone up 30K in value. To say it's a sellers market is an understatement.


All that being said, I contacted 5 companies about securing my home loan. Of the 5, UWMC was the fastest in replying, had the most competitive rates, and had the best customer service I experienced. 


What do I mean by faster replying? I heard back from Todd later that same day about my loan. Once my side of paperwork was submitted, it took... 2 days? Max? To get a pre-qualification that allowed me to make an offer. To put in perspective, I didnt hear back from the slowest until i closed (offer submitted Friday, reviewed monday, called tuesday saying it was mine if I wanted it).


What do I mean by beat rates? Better than the worst by over a whole percent.


What do I mean by best customer service? I emailed todd late saturday about some random question I had, fully expecting a response no earlier than Monday. This motherfucker hits me up with a response at 11pm that night.


Having said all this, I currently own no UWMC and do not plan on buying any just yet. Im full ape and 100% in GME. That being said, UWMC Is REAL fucking high on my GME tendie reinvestment plan.



I just felt like adding my personal experience with the company may give some perspective for someone.",t3_mpqxbf,112

Looks at ah volume 4,435. At an average price of 7.7*4,435= 34k...which was subsequently reversed a half hr later so is more likely a misprint.

I read the 10k and I don't have the numbers in front of me but I could've swore I saw they lost money and ended the year with very little in cash...

They’ll have solid Q1 earnings, Q2 should look “acceptable”, but they cannot sustain the profitability they’ve had over the past few quarters. Rates have moved up, competition is getting fierce, especially in the TPO channel (UWMs only line of business). TPO margins have dropped from over 200bps to approx 30-40bps. And they can’t make it up in volume, we just went through the biggest refi boom in history. Brokers are very well positioned to capture refinance business. Not so much on the purchase side. Most builders won’t work with them and due to the low supply of existing homes the construction to permanent business is shot up (buying a lot and building a house). Guess who rarely has the ability to offer construction to perm loans... Brokers, and UWM doesn’t at all.

Instead of a bump the share price went down and every morning it's heavily shorted.  I like the idea of value stocks. They are certainly a lot less nerve wracking for this novice trader than trying to short squeeze hedgies.

But we aren't talking about Nintendo or viac. This is a mortgage company making loans at a time when millions of people are out of work and the only thing keeping them in their homes is a moratorium on foreclosures.

Maybe the government is steady behind the wheel. Maybe they learned a lesson last time. 

But my cynical nature says they still don't give a fuck and will buy puts on mortgage companies while the rest of us go down with the ship.

There is a reason they are shorting this stock. They remember 2008 like the rest of us.

Anyway, thanks for the DD. I'm not going to put more money in right now. Everything is red and I'm broke until something goes gree or Friday and either way GME is first in line.

As for the value trap, analysts  say the average is 11.20 on Marketwatch.  [UWMC | UWM Holdings Corp.
