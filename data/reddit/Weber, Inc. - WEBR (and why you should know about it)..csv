1631790101.0,2021-08-29,wallstreetbets,hd2bki2,"Weber's charcoal kettle grill is the best. Even if you already have a gas grill, get one. It's much more satisfying to use and food will taste better. Plus you can use it as a smoker and do all kinds of stuff with it.",t3_pp84f3,5

Webber is probably a good buy but I'd wait for a dip in the next 6 months. No need to jump in this early and take on unnecessary risk.",t3_pp84f3,3
