PRO-TIP: DO NOT BUY ETFC!!

I've seen it far too many times that people see companies up big % and they try to jump in and ride the wave or try to short expecting a pull-back. Do not do this here. 

When a company gets purchased, the share price rises to the value of the buyout. It will not go above the buyout value and it will not drop below buyout value either. Once the deal is announced, it's done for the company being purchased. 

I know this sounds obvious to most, but I've seen it happen one to many times.
