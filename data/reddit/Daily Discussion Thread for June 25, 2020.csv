Global markets are in general trading in the range determined by past week and are currently in the lower end of the range

#____________________


Trade setup for today


#Spy is currently trying to find a support and such days are tricky to trade, we are looking to build long position at 305ish range with stop loss at 300 (not recommending this trade to y'all, doing this trade cause such trade tend to play out well usually)



315 comes out to be a surprising new resistance coming from this week's price action



Long term : Nasdaq not respecting it's 10k psychological support is a big red flag, we are planning to invest small quantity in quality stocks on this dip but are refraining to go big 

We are relatively flat for past 2 months, it appears we have transitioned from explansionary market to contracting market 



Today can be a surprising day and can be huge on ether side, this tends to happen on days when support is being determined, we are playing gamble by going long as the risk reward seems favorable with a bias that we might see a huge upmove intraday

Random tip for the day : ""if your derivative order gets placed almost immediately, you are most likely gonna lose on that trade""
