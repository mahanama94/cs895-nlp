* Happy St Patrick's Day

* If the market is halted/shut down on your expy date, you **cannot** trade your options and they will expire worthless if they're OTM. If they're ITM, you *can* exercise them. 

* If short selling is banned, you can  still trade your options (referencing when this happened in 2008). However, [pricing and liquidity is going to change](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi%3Fdb_name%3DACE09%26paper_id%3D143&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjK8qj3-57oAhUImHIEHd-bDo4QFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw0kPIDDUZiHl2mBlgWVyMGz).

* [Market circuit breakers](https://i.imgur.com/QiJqDkg.jpg) Would be wild if we need to know these today. 

* Sourceless fear mongering is not allowed and will result in a **permanent ban**. Provide sources for your claims, at least to us mods FIRST, or don't post it. **You are being targeted** with FUD (Fear, Uncertianty, Doubt) posts by bad actors. Dozens of posts an HOUR yesterday and they're back today. Don't ever believe -any- of it. We're removing it as fast as we can. Please report it when you see it. Bans are being given with no remorse so don't even think about any *""My X works for Y and everything is being shutdown. Ban if not true, lol""*.

* On a happy note, [the WSB Live Charity Stream](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhh5rs/the_wsb_charity_live_stream_for_autism_wednesday) is TOMORROW!",t3_fk3e9i,1
