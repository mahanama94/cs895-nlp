You chose love because you can't feel happy without it.

Yet you know you can get heartbroken, get depressed and become sad. You 'll end up like shit if you can't move on and try again.

Or you can achieve love and be happy with your life,

You will either lose alot to love or gain alot, its a chance that people have to take.
