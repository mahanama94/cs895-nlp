***Buying the dip literally worked EVERY SINGLE TIME in history.***

Reason why $SPY will always go up

One of main requirements to join the S&P 500 is:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 20 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy it can't go down by design.
