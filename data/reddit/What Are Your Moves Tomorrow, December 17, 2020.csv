1608152585.0,2020-12-17,wallstreetbets,gg2jwn0,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Once again, Stimulus Talks are going well. Congress continues to edge along the market, with current package pricing around $900b and contentious items such as liability protection along with state and local funding are off the table. Chatter says a direct payment stimulus check is included BUT the amount has not been fully disclosed yet. It is likely to be LESS than $1,200 to keep the price tag of the package in check (likely $600 for the plebs). McConnell has noted that they will NOT leave town until a law is passed. After 6 months, we totes believe them.
* BofA resumes coverage of MSFT with a bigly $256 price target, MSFT is up 2.4% during intraday high, despite AMZN pleading with the courts again to hold the 10b JEDI contract cuz Orange POTUS may have exerted undue influences on Pentagon's decision. Antitrust shit continues as Google is now being sued by TX AG over abuse of ad tech. (Who's still under FBI investigation for bribery and abuse of office. Let's see if POTUS pardons him if the ban hammer arrives now that the SCOTUS push went womp womp).
* Zuck boi complained that Apple's new iOS 14 with stringent privacy policy will have a harmful impact on many ""small"" businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. Aka fuck you Tim Apple how am I going to sell data if you lock that shit up? Shares are flat for the day.
* BA went slight red for the day after its CEO says via a memo that recovery may take 3 more years to achieve full recovery. Suspending annual merit salary increases in 2021 for most peeps. BA closed down 1.58% for the day at $255.87.
* TLRY gets a bigly lift today thanks to a reverse merger deal with APHA, soon to close the saga on one of the memest of weed stock (WSB will remember fondly when it halted multiple times in a day). TLRY is up 26% on the news during intraday high while APHA is up 4.43%.
* MT/Steel gang continues to pump in option land while the underlying is flat for the day, as call volume is well above normal and directionally bullish. 33k calls trading for the day, 24x more than expected volume as retail and funds get in on the steel train. Notable strike includes March and April $30c. Don't buy FDs you dumb fuck, the monthlies are cheap enough. Earnings is expected on Feb 11. Don't forget, someone's gotta be selling those options too.
* WISH, the discount market place where you buy shitty ass scammy Alibaba shit and post it online for upvotes, debuted today with opening trade at $22.75, below its IPO pricing of $24. Shares are down almost 14% for the day as it fades to $20.65 during intraday trading and closed down -16.45% to $20.05. Turns out not every ""tech"" IPO can be a winner.
* ABNB option trading debuted today with spreads as wide as my legs when Jpow offers me a brr. Shares ripped to as high as 12.4% during intraday, at $140. The stock closed up 10.57% for the day at $138.30. I had thought about a 140c FDs in the AM for about $1.6 a piece but pussied out. The strike touched intraday high of $6.90. Cool cool.
* FOMC release was in expectation as the Fed held rates near zero cuz money is brr, while committing to continuing buying bonds (at least $120 bil worth) till economy gets back to full employment. They see a 4.2% growth next year and a fall of unemployment rate to ""only"" 5%. Volatility ensued as 2PM struck and WSB screech in disbelief that a major Fed announcement like this can impact their weeklies. Buy the dip, retards.
* DJI closed down 435 pts to 0.15%, IXIC at +0.50% thanks to AMZN and MSFT, while SPX is at +0.18%. **GME closed 0.00%**. Be on the lookout for stimulus news which should resolve by the end of this week. Market moving numbers tomorrow: housing starts/permits, jobless claims, and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index all at at 8:30 AM ET. Quad Witching this Friday, Dec 18. The last time WSB went-all in on Quad Witching cuz hur dur MMs wont pay out the puts was April earlier this year. It didn't pan out. But turns out we were right eventually but for all the wrong reason. The best kind of correct!",t3_kehugd,332
