**my personal leading belief is Snowden is an active CIA employee who was against NSA mass data collection and hes part of a group of CIA officers that leaked the NSA spy program**

Its either that or Snowden was groomed and is part of a ChiSino intelligence conspiracy and that is a worse scenario. Also, Admiral Rodgers came out and said that Snowden was not a Chinese asset.",t1_f6j0pke,6
