Good luck to all. If I can do it, so can you. You've got this 🙏

**Edit 1:**
My breakthrough came when $NET rallied from $38 to $85. My most consistent gainer has been $SE. Ironically I got the idea for NET and SE from r/stocks ---turns out those boomers have some good stock recommendations. $JPM has also been good to me.

**Edit 2:**
My two biggest holdings currently are: (1) 70 $50c Jan 2022 $XLE calls (2) 100 $35c Jun 18 QQQJ calls.

I know XLE doesn't get a lot of love here because it's fossil fuel. While I entirely agree green and renwwables are the future, I still think oil will be with us for the short to medium term (3 to 5 years) and there is still money to be made in that sector.",t3_lgdb2j,506

Not because they believe people should have rights to it, but because the states that do legalize it will be making stupid money. TLRY and APHA are joining to create one of the largest weed companies in the world. Yes their value may be moving rapidly but with the UK deal and a blue US government this is more than likely a value play that boomers were too stupid to see and shorted.
