KMX - CarMax is having earnings tomorrow morning 8:30 AM, car prices are at record highs, overall market sentiment and the fact this was shit on from ATH makes this ripe to pop.  Bullish.

PLTR - Palanqueer is having the run of it's life, might be in for a gamma squeeze tomorrow with so many new calls ITM.  This runs a buck or two and we might be kissing 30. Big Balls Bullish.

SOFI -  Banking's a bitch, especially with out interest rates. This one is riding the bottom of a channel and has been consolidating.  Solid fundamentals, looks like it wants to make a big move, we'll see which way.  Bullish - but, like, a nervous bull. 

My last pick is the SPAC merging with Buzzfeed News.  I hate their company, I think they are click bait trash.  Buuuutttt, I bet they are good for a little pop, and the downside risk is small because this is a SPAC and it's trading below the NAV.  Look that one up on your own retards.",t3_o78qyx,12
