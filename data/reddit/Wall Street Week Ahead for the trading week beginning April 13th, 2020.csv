2019-10-26,wallstreetbets,fn3lu68,"I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again. The stock market, and specifically the S&P500, is NOT the economy. The S&P500 is the largest companies that have the cash to ride out this period and come out on top after all of their smaller competitors have been wiped out. Labor and materials will be cheaper, weakened demand in some areas (especially luxury goods) will be offset by increased demand in consumer staples and pent-up demand for travel, lodging and entertainment. A lot of the recent layoffs WILL be permanent, which is actually a positive from Wall Street’s perspective. 

TL;DR long large cap stocks

SPY 275-305c 5/15, 6/19, 9/30
