i developed it as the third leg of my vice trifecta consisting of painkillers and alcohol to make up for the lack of fulfillment and purpose in my life. i keep yolo'ing all the money i earn into tickers i know nothing about and retardedly risky options plays in a last ditch effort, hoping that being rich will provide meaning and motivation for me to continue living, or that losing all my money and living under a bridge will finally provide me with enough incentive to off myself when i've previously been too cowardly to do it.

it's to the point where I've been trying to sleep absurdly early in the day (sometimes as early as 4 PM PST) because nothing but the stock market excites me or convinces me to get up and do that whole Staying Alive thing everybody seems to expect me to do. i've become increasingly more comfortable with writing off more and more losses as ""I'll win it back later"" and dissatisfied with any gain under four digits.

Also the feeling of need for purpose is a social construct.  There are ways of thinking like Taoism that deemphasize the need for purpose and find fulfillment in other ways, like accepting yourself and your imperfections.  

Existentialism is cool too but nihilism is always a danger.

1617929692.0,2021-04-09,wallstreetbets,gtvmsfc,"Well....started 'investing' back when the first /u/ironyman meme came out, about his box spreads and breaking robinhood. I put 80 bucks in to buy 3 shares of AMD before their earnings, because I knew their 7nm cards would be hot. I made 20 dollars.

Thought..wow, if only I'd used options instead! Then I got really lucky one FED interest rate day, popped from 2k to 6k...then held overnight due to PDT worries, lost half in my sleep. Let the rest of my FD's bleed out and went essentially back down to my original investment +1k or something.

This brought on the 'tilt' trading. I was throwing 1k at VXX FD's and not selling at the right time, then some tard on here was saying ""mortgage your house and buy this Boeing dip"". I was all in boeing for a bit, that killed me. I kept throwing money in and occasionally turning a brief profit only to throw it back on the fire.

(and I also have losses on etrade and TDA, my only success has been my passively invested Roth where I hold gold miner penny stocks and sell covered calls, up 55%...)

edit: I forgot...most of this loss is from me trying to short AMD from 30 bucks until they hit 60-70. Then I gave up on them forever.",t1_gtvmb6o,31
