Just be careful, newcomers, is all I'm saying. The BAG (BB, AMC, GME) Holy Trinity of Meme Stocks has made more victims than Lambo owners. Use your best judgment and don't forget that even when a stock crashes and burns, this subreddit will be filled with lies like ""tasty dip yumm just bought another 10000 shares.""

Apes are noobs buying memes and holding them through 1000% gains and losses. 

Autists are nerds doing adderall drawing crayon charts and reading 50 pages about a mattress company nobody thought to buy or Rite Aid... fucking Rite Aid and making bank. Michael Burry shit. 

Retards are people buying shit at the tippy top or bears yoloing on puts while the money printer was on blast last year. Sometimes they get lucky and got in the ticker of autist DD and didn’t think twice or even know what the company did.

This was a swing trade so I held over night and into the opening the next day.  My plan was to hold and increase my stop limit as the price rose.    Well BB started to dip ( in which I expected but still held). At around the 12.20 mark ( I was down 700) but had confidence the stock would soon rebound.  I decided to order a stop limit at 12.00 just in case the stock bottomed out but instead of a stop limit I mistakenly put in a limit order which sold the stock immediately for. 700 dollar loss,  as soon as the order executed BB spike to 16.23 and since I was on a cash account I could not jump in.
