1577479199.0,2019-12-27,wallstreetbets,fc6fa44,"Happy Friday and **Magical Crayons TA** time because volume is so low that I don't anticipate a huge change in price action.

[Yesterday's prediction was pretty spot on](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eg0ypn/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_27/fc3rxcg/)-- we mooned intraday and we're about to close flat. As of this post we're at 0.02% green and I don't expect us to deviate too much from it (i.e. <0.05% change EOD).

I've been pretty accurate lately but honestly, because it's a lower volume market algos are fucking around more so their behavior is a bit easier to guess. My predictions are mostly crayon driven so I'm not doing anything particular special. To illustrate, yesterday we closed just below the trendline and after decently strong futures action [we opened to challenge resistance in the morning and got knocked down.](https://imgur.com/w3mG22y)  There are a few other minor indicators that go into making the predictions of course but the supports/resistances and trendlines are the key components of crayons that I try to report.

As it's the close of the week I've redrawn crayons in anticipation of next week. How do things look? Again I can't predict until I see Monday's action, but for those anticipating the rug pull I actually think the setup looks pretty decent for it. Not the big one, but a small correction. VIX is starting to wake up after consolidation near its lows and IWM (small caps) has started to sputter lately after finally breaking out of a consolidation. 

If something happens I don't anticipate a huge % crash or something-- more like bleeding back the gains of this week-- but regardless, what will be important to watch is Monday action. If we start going red it means we might be heading towards that lower support range (i.e. 319-320ish). If not, with the redrawn crayons 325 would be in play before EOW.

That's it boys. See you in the weekend thread and hold your tendies close and your autism even closer.",t3_eg9wuw,7
