I was fearful of being fired you see so I kept swerving around trying to stay ahead of the flow of traffic. I eventually lost control and my car began to spin and slam over the edge of a bridge. 

From hundreds of feet up I could see water approaching fast. I closed my eyes and accepted death. That's when the car stopped. An armored Tesla suit had caught my vehicle. I couldn't believe it. It dropped me off back safely.

The suit of armor was just about to take off when I had to know who it was. I asked ""Could I at least know my savior?""

Thats when the suit's helmet flipped up, revealing Elon Musk and his not exactly rugged but handsome face. I immediately climaxed but I had to keep my cool. He kissed me on the cheek and said. ""Godspeed"".

I never saw him again.
