‚ÄúIf we are plateauing, we are plateauing at a very high level,‚Äù Cuomo said. ‚ÄúStaying at this level is problenatic‚Äù

The governor also noted that if the crisis is starting to hit its apex, it‚Äôs because social distancing is working, which is why those restrictions need to remain in place for now.

Now only those few who had a test confirmation *before* dying are marked as victims of coronavirus on their death certificate.

\- Keep the strike price within %5-%10 OTM  
\- Get an expiry of no less than 45 days out (preferably 60 days out).  
\- Sell when you hit %30 profit  
\- Hedge your gay positions  
\- Don't watch the 1m chart  
\- Buy calls on -%4 days- Buy puts on +4% days  
\- Know when to cut your losses (Diamond hands are dumb - opportunity cost)
