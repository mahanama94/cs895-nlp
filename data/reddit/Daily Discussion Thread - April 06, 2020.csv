The state’s schools and non-essential businesses will remain closed for at least another three weeks.

Cuomo chastized residents who are not taking the order seriously, warning that there has been “a laxness on social distancing, especially over this past weekend, that is just wholly unacceptable.”

“Now is not the time to be lax,” Cuomo said. He added that he will be raising the fine for violating the order from $500 to $1,000, and he will be asking police officers to be “more aggressive on the enforcement” of the order.

New York officials said the state may be at the apex, or the beginning of the apex, of its coronavirus crisis.

But governor Andrew Cuomo warned that this potential development is not all good news because the state’s healthcare system is stretched to a breaking point.

“If we are plateauing, we are plateauing at a very high level,” Cuomo said. “Staying at this level is problenatic”

The governor also noted that if the crisis is starting to hit its apex, it’s because social distancing is working, which is why those restrictions need to remain in place for now.

My take - it may or may not have hit the apex but that's only because of social distancing. The moment they pull those restrictions it'll be all hell break loose.",t3_fvwu06,12

- Vaccine won’t be ready for another 14-16 months

Due to that last point, I think the trend will continue to be down. Yes, we may finally have a grip on the first wave, but we still need to prepare for a second wave. Our economy won’t be going back to “normal” for another year at least.",t3_fvwu06,29

\- Keep the strike price within %5-%10 OTM  
\- Get an expiry of no less than 45 days out (preferably 60 days out).  
\- Sell when you hit %30 profit  
\- Hedge your gay positions  
\- Don't watch the 1m chart  
\- Buy calls on -%4 days- Buy puts on +4% days  
\- Know when to cut your losses (Diamond hands are dumb - opportunity cost)

These are my gay tips. GL out there p00nz.
