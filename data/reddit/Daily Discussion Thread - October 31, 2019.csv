1572553037.0,2019-10-31,wallstreetbets,f5ya1bz,"Hello everyone and welcome back to **Magical Crayons TA.**

Today's trading did not go as [predicted yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpcu87/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_october_31/f5uc0ef/) In spite of the rate cut, good earnings from major companies like AAPL and FB and SBUX, the market instead decided to dip. Ostensibly it was because of Gyna trade deal news and Chicago PMI bombing, but of course who knows for certain. 

We have fallen back into trends that happened prior to rate cut announcement. I have accompanying magical crayons here showing this, [with the white circle being the FOMC announcement where we breached into hopium range and the white lines being the way we were trending prior and today's action back into normal bullishness.](https://imgur.com/yd95YLV)

What happens now? It's difficult to say for certain. We are now back in a lower tier of bullish trading, but make no mistake we're still bullish. For bears, you again can see from [the orange magical crayons posted above](https://imgur.com/yd95YLV) the multiple resistances we have to cross to have sufficient sell signals to come out of hibernation. For bulls, today's small pullback is better for a longer-term bull market-- you would actually prefer flat trading at these ranges for today and Monday, as we were in a rising wedge pattern to about November 7th. 

We'll have economic news tomorrow as many of you know and we should expect it to be neutral to bad. If the market doesn't respond strongly and continues flat trading, it bodes well for slightly longer dated calls that are OTM. If it rises quickly on bad news, it would be best to sell at 304 to lock in profits because anything past that breaks back into hopium range, which couldn't be sustained in spite of neutral/good news yesterday. For bears you're looking for the collapse of the 300.8 resistance to start entering with confidence.

See you all tomorrow and bless your portfolios.

Lets get into it:

Recently, we received the FOMC news that the FED cut rates three times in a row. The dollar, soon after, tanked and gold has a fresh breath of air. It has a reason to rally - global banks all over the world are cutting rates in lieu of facing a recession. They want to do QE? That's fine with me, gold will continue to breakout as long as the government deflates the dollar and safe havens like precious metals and bonds keep getting bought up.

So, from a macro perspective, gold has plenty of reasons to run. It has hit all-time-highs in EVERY major currency except for the USD. 

As debt increases, gold becomes substantially more attractive. https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Global-Debt.png

The global flat currencies will keep declining...gold will keep rising.

http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2019_ft/JUL-DEC/global-central-banks-have-been-net-buyers-of-gold-since-2010-05212019-LG.png

Gold is being bought up by central bankers, more so than any other entity.
