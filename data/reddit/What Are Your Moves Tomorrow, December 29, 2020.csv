1609190672.0,2020-12-29,wallstreetbets,ghbrdxt,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* After a long three day weekend and trolling the entire country, POTUS finally signs the stimulus bill, despite House/Senate GOP bucking against the $2,000 checks. Of course, because POTUS signed the bill a day late, many people (in the 12 mil batch) under unemployment may now face a lapse in weekly payments and are absolutely fucked due to the Orange One. But nbd! It's only just the holiday season and honestly, why can't these people just buy TSLA calls and pay rent with the gains? Sheesh!
* The indexes all responded favorably to the passing of the omnibus and stimulus bill, putting this clusterfuck behind us as govt shutdown is averted. Despite a slight pullback this morning, Nasdaq is up more than 0.88% during intraday high while SPX is up 0.91% - both propelled by big tech Tim AAPL, Jeff AMZN, and what's-his-name GOOGL. Despite opening up almost 1%, small caps pulled back to flat during intraday trading and RUT closed out the day red at -0.38%.
* Chinese ADR/ADS continues to be pressured today though BABA reverted from its opening red to claw back to green, after shares of the Chinese behemoth retreated another -7.98% in Heng Sheng market. During intraday low, JD was down -3.85%, PDD -6.02%, MPNGF -4.30%, and TCEHY -3.41%. This pullback is no exception for Chinese EVs as NIO, XPEV, and LI are all punished today, closing out at -3.82%, -9.17%, and -7.88%, respectively. No doubt plenty of WSBer are catching the knives of these Cayman Island holding companies. 
* In today's ridiculous pump: A-C-Y is up 1,314% before being halted by NYSE. Avg volume on this micro-cap is typically 72k volume, but today's pump resulted in a 34 mil volume trade. Things heated up at 10:15 am when an almost 1 mil order flow of A-C-Y came in, propelling the stock from $6.12 to $6.3 and within less than 40 mins shares went from $8 to $10, $15 to $20, $25+ to closed out at $38 before being halted. No doubt this will dump spectacularly once it resumes trading. While usually not commenting on market activity/rumors, AeroCentury noted that they are unaware of any undisclosed material change/development in its biz that would account for this unusual market activity. 
* For the 3rd year in a row, AMZN propels itself to the stratosphere after Christmas. In past years, shares are generally up 3-4% for the day thanks to spectacular holiday numbers being released on the Monday after Xmas. Except this year AMZN didn't bother to release their sales number at all (usually during pre-market) but the stock decides to go on a moon mission anyway. Yours truly realized about 16k in AMZN gains via monthly + scalping weekly calls today but being a true degen, you can only think about the money left on the table had you diamond hand the weeklies bought in the morning. Most weeklies were up 400-500% for the day. Alas.
* There's a clear rotation back into big tech today, with all the big bois closing the day out with strong gains. Wedbush noted that US tech stocks will benefit from the Chinese tech crackdown, and what we're seeing may be a flow back to US big tech from Chinese big tech and small caps.
* Cloud sector and stay-at-home stocks took a nice beating today after select sub-sector (security) have had an incredible run-up from the SWI hacks. CRWD is down -3.88%, ZS -2.87%, DDOG -5.70%, DOCU -6.42%, FSLY -7.46%, NET -8.80%, ZM -6.34%, PTON -6.48%, and ETSY -6.41%. As Warren Buffett often says, ""buy the dip, you homoerotic retards.""
* A similar sell-off is happening for vaccine stocks as BNTX took a -9.13% dive, MRNA -9.72%, and NVAX -9.66%. Party might be over on these valuations as vaccine distribution continues.
* In WSB meme land, GME is up ""slightly"" at 3.97%, after initially running up more than 7% during pre-market and in morning trading. GME bros are up bigly and have been giving out platinum like candy (pretty sure I got a handful plats, some from a post as far back [as a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e3kpbc/gme_yolo_monthend_update_nov_2019/f93qv6d/)). PLTR took another trip to the red land as WSB bagholders continue to reel from the sell-off as shares closed the day down -7.64%. Wasn't this stock supposed to be at $50 already? This is clearly the work of market MaNiPuLaTiOn as PLTR's organic growth of going up 300% in one month is being hampered by the boomers. No new news on MT as the stock is as flat again given the play always requires the market to catch up to steel pricing and eventual earnings reflecting said pricing. MARA closed the day up 12.18% and RIOT is up 19.28% for the day, propelled by renewed ATH for c-o-i-n-s.
* The House will vote on the $2,000 stimulus checks later today, though it remains doubtful how far this bill amendment will go in the still GOP controlled Senate. All eyes are on the GA run-off election as that'll determine the possibility of a next stimulus (if any), while polls are awfully close for both races. The current aggregate from 538 has Perdue at 47.9% vs Ossoff at 47.8% while Warnock is at 48.3% and Loeffler is at 47.3%. If Dems somehow take control of the Senate, prepare for some interesting market movements, particularly in the healthcare sector (ANTM, UNH, HUM, etc.). 
* The market closed at new records today with S&P at 3,753 pts, Nasdaq at 12,899, and the Dow at 30,403. Somewhere out there, a WSBer is still buying puts. F in the chat for April 2020 and May 2020 puts. Don't worry 🌈 bois, the second leg is just around the corner.

This next part is interesting because if the republican senate votes no they risk losing the runoff elections in georgia to the dems who have been swearing up and down they will pass another 3 trillion dollar cares act. While politicians words are not the most trustworthy things at best, the very idea of the conservative senate flipping to the dems would give dems complete control of congress and the presidency, effectively meaning they can pass whatever they want.

While not promised things on the menu and how they could affect your portfolio:

Cares Act 2: All stocks to the moon

Federal Decriminalization of marijuana possession: Weed stocks to the moon.

Further EV incentives and alternative energy bills: Green stocks to the moon, oil stocks down flat for 4 years if not down.

Healthcare changes: no impact unless medicare for all is passed, very unlikely in this political climate but could tank all non covid health insurers and or pharma companies.

Pulling back in the middle east: military contractors down (PLTR, BA, Raytheon, etc.)
