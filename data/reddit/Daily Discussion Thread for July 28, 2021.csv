There is a new COVID variant on the horizon that will likely lead to shutdowns again.  Eviction moratoriums are ending soon that will lead to massive mortgage failure. Commodities are skyrocketing in prices leading to higher grocery and gas bills.  If the Feds even think about doing anything to the interest rates, that will start the spiral of one of the worst financial crises in a hundred years, especially with boomers starting to pull their retirement funds for retirement.

1. Restaurants will actually have to pay employees enough to live and treat them like humans i.e. give them time off work
2. Restaurants will all get more expensive

The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.",t3_ot6uaz,10
