#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 




#____________________


Asian markets have been green, but are lagging when compared to global markets


**India** up 0.32% 

**Hangseng**  up 0.17% 

**Nikkei** up 2.22%


#_____________________



Europe might look like bulls are about to cum but the reality is that we are testing the upward resistance in monthly chart and all we can do is watch with pop corn

**Dax** up 0.95% 


**CAC40** up 0.84%


**FTSE** up 0.93%


#_____________________


**Dow futures** (26,094.0) +117.0 (+0.45%)

#____________________

Global markets  have said bye bye to their support and have moved on to test their upward resistance, big moves are being built up and the direction will be decided based on the action at this resistance

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

We are eye to eye with 320 and as soon 314 was convincingly broken upwards we knew what's next and we are witnessing that today

**Weekly ranges are support at 307 and 310 and resistance at 314 and 320**

We are currently at the top of the weekly ranges, all we can do today is how the market behaves at 320, we might hover around lower 320s (i.e. 320 -325) but please don't confuse this as a breakout cause it's zone and not a point

#Personal bias is that today we will trade between 317 - 325 (yes this a broad range cause we will be surprised how wild today it's gonna be)

#____________________


**Longterm** : some of the supports in the long charts have time and again proven their strength, and the risk of downside is limited, invest in SIP mode tho to benefit the volitality

**Market is on verge of normalizing and stocks might now finally start performing on their individual personality rather than all together so start picking stocks accordingly**




#____________________


**Random tip for the day** : ""a good trader is not the one who is right 100% of the time, but a good trader is the one who is right more times than he is wrong ""

**(Don't let few bad trades bring you down )**



#____________________

**Spy Pre-market**  (319.13)  +1.54 (0.48%)

**Crude oil** (39.67) -0.88 (-2.17%)
