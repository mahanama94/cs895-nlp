2pm - 215pm - Fed rate decision and statement.  There will be an initial move based on the Feds decision and statement. This usually results in the sub running around with their dicks hanging out screaming about bears/bulls being fucked, etc...*whatever you do, do not FOMO in at this point*

230pm - 3pm - JPow news conference...usually where the real move starts.  *much safer time to FOMO*

I think today spikes at the initial decision of a rate cut, gets a little chaotic as the statement is digested and then tanks when Powell starts talking about how strong the economy is.",t3_dp574l,31
