Hold your loved ones close and treasure every moment with them. Your job and the market will always be there. Wish I hadn’t spent so much time focusing on them to the detriment of other more important things the last few years.

Anyways, tonight I'm watching Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Its pretty good. I have been to Stockholm a few times and while I am scheduled to go to Italy as soon as the borders reopen, Scandinavia will certainly be the place I create a legendary frequent fliers miles account with.

The story is complex but not convoluted, decidedly feminist without the ""Yas Kween"" element, and deliberately malevolent in a both a combination of in your face moments as well as in subtlety.
