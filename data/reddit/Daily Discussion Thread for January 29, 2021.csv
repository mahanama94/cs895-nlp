It's been a very tough day at the hedge fund.  Rupert's daughter had to sell her backup BMW.  I had to scale back my flight to Boston from a Gulfstream to a Learjet.  I absolutely hate Learjets.  But Melvin says we need to cut back.  

There are rumors around the office that we might need to even cut out bonuses.  I am in shock.  I earned my 10 million dollar bonus fair and square, by coming up with the idea to short Bed Bath and Beyond.  Sure, the trade ended up losing us about a hundred million dollars, but my fundamental analysis was very good.

Anyways, hopefully things get better soon.  Our friends at Robin Hood are doing everything they can to get us back on track.

Seeing the entire political spectrum band together on twitter to support us working class citizens and defend our right to free trade. Seeing the backlash against the media for their spin against us. And finally, seeing the outpour of support from redditors around the entire **world**, coming to us in our darkest hour to stand alongside us, buying and holding like champions.

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.
It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.
DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.
It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair.

**GME SQUEEZE**

Credit to [u/PsychoticC4rrot](https://www.reddit.com/u/PsychoticC4rrot)

**Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!**

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the fund that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

**READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!**

**EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!**

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is **""Days to Cover""** or **""Short Ratio""** .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? **You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""**

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, **it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.**

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning **if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!** So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. **No need to panic sell.** No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the **short ratio.** If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, **NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? **$1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number.** If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

1611921624.0,2021-01-29,wallstreetbets,gl84lon,"I don’t think the average joe realizes at how guarantee this money actually is. They can’t comprehend the amount of shares that NEED to be purchased tomorrow by market makers to cover all the call options, as well as if the hedge funds decide to cover some of their shorts at the same time.

Guys when people BUYING shares is more than the people SELLING shares, the stock will go up. Tomorrow and next week there will be a huge influx in people who are FORCED TO BUY! We’re talking like an entire week of volume compressed into a single fucking day.

Let me explain it further.

I have a call option for GME expiring today. The strike price is $320. 1 option contract is 100 shares. When I sell that contract today, the market makers have to buy 100 shares at whatever the going price is at the time I sell my option. Now multiple that by 10,000-100,000 contracts that are expiring today, then multiply those contracts by 100 shares per contract. We’re talking TENS OF MILLIONS OF SHARES must be purchased today by ONLY the market makers.

Now the guys who shorted the stock - still need to eventually cover their short positions. They still need to buy back the shares they owe. Do they do it today? Probably not because the price is going to jump drastically. They will wait until next week until they can try to calm the price down a bit and manipulate the people even more.

It’s beautiful that the price will jump when the options expire today, but we aren’t here for that price, so don’t think you have to sell today. The real sell happens when the SHORT positions start getting forced to buy shares. We’re talking billions of dollars guys.

Take this from a guy who traded his first option on Wednesday so I’m sure half of what I said is wrong and I’m a fucking autistic retard.
