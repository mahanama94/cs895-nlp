1617879013.0,2021-04-08,wallstreetbets,gtsn09a,"Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That‚Äôs as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it‚Äôs not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn‚Äôt expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week‚Äôs 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

That‚Äôs all we got today. Don‚Äôt worry, next week earnings kick off and things should get more interesting.",t3_mmog6c,62
