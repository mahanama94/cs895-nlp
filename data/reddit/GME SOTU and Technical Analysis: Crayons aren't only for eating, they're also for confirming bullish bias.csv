Obviously this is different because it involves stuff that's more complex and non-random, but I just would like more information about it and I'm interested in getting the best source.

bearish in the short term sure, but GME has been in a clear, albeit volatile, uptrend since august 2020. has a lot of levels to lose to be truly bearish, 165, 151, 137, 110, 48, 40. anything is possible",t1_h58qdv3,48

1626363364.0,2021-01-23,wallstreetbets,h5aaze5,"The only way I‚Äôve made buying puts on GME profitable is getting in at the top and targeting farther out Expiry. 

I Bought an 8/16 300p when it peaked last month and have been day trading diagonal spreads against it (selling closer to expiry puts). I did the same with a 7/16 240P, but I‚Äôm just letting that ride. 

The 240P breakeven is 185 at expiry, but by selling puts against it along the way, the breakeven ends up more around 210 from the premium collected from day trading the short diagonal put. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about running a ZEBRA (zero extrinsic back ratio) next time it rallies really hard. That is buying two -
70 delta puts and selling a -50 delta put in the cycle, 60 days out. That gives you minimal extrinsic value but -100 delta, which emulates shorting 100 shares with capped losses (since my brokers won‚Äôt let me short GME).",t1_h58tx3g,3

I mentioned it earlier but trying to call what GME does is idiotic. It‚Äôs never ‚Äúover‚Äù. For all we know, this thing can rise to $400 again by the end of the month and there won‚Äôt be anything in the TA that predicts that.",t1_h59gh9n,18
