1608833273.0,2020-12-24,wallstreetbets,ggx1jm5,"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* After POTUS' surprise backlash against the stimulus bill, rightly making fun of the bigly lame $600 check - House Dems moved quickly to try and pass the $2,000 amount they've been trying to secure now that POTUS has made a very public statement on it. McTurtle, now put into a no-win situation has been trying to weasel out of it by political maneuvering. GOP and House GOP is now pointing to foreign spending cut as a means to push back and ""secure"" the $2,000 amount to Americans. House Dems are moving to another vote on Monday now that today's vote was blocked by House GOP. Meanwhile, as the bill stays stalled on POTUS's desk, the likelihood of a govt shutdown and lapse in UI payments for the 12 million unemployed Americans increases. Good times all around!
* China, after making various antitrust statement in the past months has finally made good on their threat as they launch an antitrust probe on BABA. Shares of BABA drilled 9% in HK market and was down as much as 17% in US market during intraday low to $211. It'll be interesting to see if this will have actual material impact for BABA once the dust settles, but given how they blocked Ant's IPO, something is likely to come out of this instead of some unknown internal political posturing. BABA closed down -13.34% to $222. Shares of rival PDD is up big on the news, closing the day out up almost 9% to $152.75, while JD is down slightly -1.10% to $84.49.
* In WSB meme stock land, GME closed with red day, pulling back slightly to end the day at -2.04% to close at $20.15. RIP to all those that went all-in on $21c and $22c FDs this week and didn't take gains. MT continues to trade fairly flat as its a long-play, once again, don't buy weeklies you dumb fuck. PLTR also close out red for the day, down -3.28% back to the cursed $27 range to close at $27.75. TSLA was able to close out its first week of S&P trading on a green day, though its down overall for the week. TSLA closed up 2.44% at $661.77 after reversing from a fairly red opening yesterday morning.
* The market edged out a green day yet again, with Dow up 0.2%, S&P up 0.4%, and Nasdaq up 0.3%. It's Christmas Eve and the market has closed early, so if you're still hoping to get out of your 0dte FDs then you've done fucked up. Market closes tomorrow on Christmas day and no doubt the 3 day weekend will force WSB to yet again have an existential crisis as they wonder what they've been doing all year long and why haven't they become a TSLA/GME/insert-ticker-that-hasn't-sucked millionaire yet.
