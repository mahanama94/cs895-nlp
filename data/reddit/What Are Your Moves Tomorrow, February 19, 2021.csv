After talking with them for about five minutes I realized they had no idea what they wanted to do except that they wanted to use wallstreetbets to do it. They didn't know if they wanted to aggregate data, or if they wanted to tell people what to buy. Then they kinda wanted to do both. Then they only wanted to do the former.

They didn't think to ask us if we had any input before they named it ""Wallstreetbets Analytics"", immediately made a discord and a github which they control, already **talked to ""angel investors""** and think they will get things for free from these people, and decided it was ""happening whether we supported it or not"" as they said to me.

Needless to say, I don't trust them, they have nothing to offer the community that the developers contributing themselves don't bring, etc. If you want to make something like that get in touch with us and we'd be happy to make sure it doesn't break any rules.",t3_lmx3k3,1

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fred-economic-data/id451715489

It’s called FRED it’s all the info the FED publishes

And his brother EDGAR

https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html

Where the SEC stores all company filings (just search by ticker) 

I don’t normally aim to educate here but for those of you that actually know how to read, have critical thinking skills, and in general ever stood a chance in the world of finance in the first place, those two links and a decent broker with news releases (I like ToS) are legitimately home to every bit of info you need to make it in this game.

Alternatively “feel the market” and maybe you’ll get lucky. 

If you’re still reading this even though there weren’t any emojis, well you just might make it.
