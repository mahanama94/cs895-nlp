After talking with them for about five minutes I realized they had no idea what they wanted to do except that they wanted to use wallstreetbets to do it. They didn't know if they wanted to aggregate data, or if they wanted to tell people what to buy. Then they kinda wanted to do both. Then they only wanted to do the former.

They didn't think to ask us if we had any input before they named it ""Wallstreetbets Analytics"", immediately made a discord and a github which they control, already **talked to ""angel investors""** and think they will get things for free from these people, and decided it was ""happening whether we supported it or not"" as they said to me.

Needless to say, I don't trust them, they have nothing to offer the community that the developers contributing themselves don't bring, etc. If you want to make something like that get in touch with us and we'd be happy to make sure it doesn't break any rules.",t3_lmx3k3,1
