1.	Wait for a correction/“dip”, for example like the one we are all suffering through.
2.	Buy options for cheap on real companies that are actually successful and growing over time, not P&D garbage or whatever random ticker is shorted.
3.	Catalyst (for example, JPow speaking in 90 min).
4.	Stock goes up. Your bet makes you money without relying on obscure market mechanics that 10% of this sub *maybe* has even the slightest understanding of.
