&#x200B;

Okay:

look i sell every day at 2est because that's when the Nordic market closes and I don't want to hold overnight. Yesterday I was about to sell for a nice profit. Then China trade news comes and I lose my profit..

&#x200B;

Then today, I'm about to sell when the SPX is down .03%. Guess what happens at 159est? FT comes out with a fucking report saying some trade bullshit and I sell when SPX is down .15%, and since I'm obviously leveraged a stupid amount of times over I lose most of my profit.

Fuck this.
