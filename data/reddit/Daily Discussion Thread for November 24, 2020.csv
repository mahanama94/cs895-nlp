1606241079.0,2020-11-24,wallstreetbets,gdgsump,"I don't think people understand how SPACS work especially with THCB. I'll break it down specifically for THCB.

If you buy THCB warrants, you straight up do in fact lose ALL of your money, if the merger fails. The deadline for THCB is Dec-6. This is NOT a hard deadline. IMHO the worst case scenario in this hot market is the SPAC gets a deadline extension, which must be approved within 24hrs. All of this is in the 14A documents. Right now the warrants are 1:1 and trade at $1.80. it means that for every $1.80  you spend on a single warrant you have the rights to buy a single THBC common stock. This is a ""good"" ratio as warrants can be as high as 4-6 warrants per stock. These warrants are saying for each warrant you can buy THCB stock post merger for $11.50. If the stock reaches over $18 and stays that way for over 20 days THCB/Microvast has the right to redeem all the warrants you have for literally a penny each, a 99%+ lose. **However** that's only if you don't have the cash to exercise the warrant. For example if you spent $2000 buying 1000 warrants. You need to have ($11.50 * 1000 = $11.5k) in 30 days or you are SOL. This may be attractive to some people because you only spent $2k in the short term to make ($18 * 1000 - $11.50 * 1000) = $6.5k (over 300% gain vs 50% gainn buying shares)

 If you are in common stock you are on a safer ""investment"" as the worst case scenario is that the merger fails. In this scenario all of the insider shareholders are barred from participating in liquidation. Liquidation is public and through THCB buying 100% of all shares at market value from a $280 million + interest trust fund that has enough money to buy all outstanding shares for $10 a share. In other words you aren't selling to prevent a 100% loss you are selling to prevent a loss down to available funding. 

So that's about it, barring NKLA levels of scamming (e.g no lockouts, mass dilution etc), which I can go into later if people want. It's not a terrible play. Microvast has legitimate battery news, and THBC does have legitimate investors. They have several Nov 2020 13F filings from Goldman,  Royal bank of canada, Morgan Stanley, etc who have all invested into the SPAC.",t3_k03375,33
