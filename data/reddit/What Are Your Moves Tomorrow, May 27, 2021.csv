Careers are like relationships. If wonders, suspicions, and doubts become an all too recurrent theme - about whether it is worth your emotional investment, the weight and duration of your efforts, the disappointments, the sacrifices, the tedious lulls to the unnerving volatility or the mere passage of time; the heart of heart already knows the answer. There will be mornings where you wander aimlessly in a hopium haze of desperation, believing that desperation alone can somehow improve your circumstances. A cocktail of hope and fear becomes your only exit strategy. But on those occasions, the anchors of inertia will remind you that nothing has changed and that the cement on your boots are congealing quickly. If there is no learning, growth or progress; if you can‚Äôt see a directed path along your future trajectory; if you are constantly dwelling on missed opportunities of the past while sheepishly eyeing every other greener pasture, the heart knows that it was an engagement that should have ended as a hapless summer romance, at best.",t3_nlq1js,1
