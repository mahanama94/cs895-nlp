1591736941.0,2020-06-09,wallstreetbets,ftin16h,"piece of article that came out in barrons today. 'The S&P 500 Has Erased Its 2020 Losses. The Fed's Money FLood Suggests Room to Run'. ""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged to do more, assuring investors that the central bank has more firepower and is willing to use it. To that point, the Fed on Monday said it would expand its Main Street lending program by lowering the minimum loan amount, raising the maximum loan limit, extending loan terms, and allowing businesses to defer principal payments for two years instead of one. 

On the surface, [the rally over the past two weeks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-economy-is-bad-but-stocks-are-rallying-heres-one-reason-why-51590659100?mod=article_inline) appears to have been driven by an earlier-than-expected and smoother-than-feared gradual reopening of the economy and signs of consumer resilience, says Shalett. Aside from the surprise rise in payrolls, personal income grew 10.5% in April and the savings rate jumped to 33%. That’s as initial jobless claims, while still high, have continued their weekly decline, manufacturing surveys beat expectations, May auto sales improved, and mortgage applications increased for the seventh straight week. 

Deeper down, Shalett says, Fed-driven liquidity is booming in a way that can help sustain asset prices. “All told, this strong data validates the market narrative of a V-shaped recovery,” Shalett says. "" by Lisa Beilfuss",t3_gzkapz,12
