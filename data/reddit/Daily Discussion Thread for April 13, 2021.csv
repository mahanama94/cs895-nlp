I  just received a 200+page booklet in the mail as a TLRY/APHA shareholder  and thought I'd share some of the information with you guys.

\- The Aphria live audio meeting will take place on April 14th at 4:00pm EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)

\- The Tilray meeting will take place on April 16th at 11:00am EST at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TLRY2021SM)

\-  shareholders of APHA will receive 0.8381 of a share of TLRY at the  merger (I wonder why Tilray's trading lower than Aphria right now? *edit:  oh, my broker shows tilray in USD but aphria in CAD so it's confusing,  they're trading at roughly .833 difference which is normal*)

\-  the two companies combined will create the world's largest global  cannabis company, with pro forma revenue of US$685m (C$874m) for the  last 12 mo. prior to the Dec.16/20 merger announcement.

\-  shareholders will vote on approvals for Tilray's charter amendment,  share issuance, advisory compensation, and adjournment proposals to  revise them;

\- increase the authorized capital stock of TLRY from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 (890m class 2 common, 10m preferred)

There's  a lot of information to pore over in the booklet, these are just some  quick points. I am not a financial advisor, use this information at your  own peril.",t3_mpz5br,13
