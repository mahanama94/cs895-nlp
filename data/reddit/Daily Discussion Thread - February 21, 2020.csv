**You will be permanently banned.**

If your posts read similar to: ""buy $ticker!"", ""which stonk are we pumping next?"", ""ALL In $ticker"", ""(insert emojis here)"" you will be banned. 

If you don't know what to do with your money, use a savings account for right now and read investopedia.

1582307216.0,2020-02-21,wallstreetbets,fiarxey,"On ALLY... The market is clearly overreacting to their recent acquisition. They're riding the market waves and increasing their customer base, yes. But they have $180 billion in assets and literally spent $2.6 billion purchasing the company... so basically 1% of their assets and the company they purchased (CardWorks) has over $1 billion in revenue annually. Furthermore the purchase was half cash half stock deal. So they diluted their ownership slightly to make the acquisition.

And due to average household income remaining stagnant, with rising living costs, credit is used widely by consumers.

The infrastructure from the purchase will allow them to integrate the systems to drastically increase their credit card offerings to many more customers and also have more control over the terms they set. Their current credit card offerings are tailored to more credit worthy consumers but previously had been through a third party supplier.

Sure, they take on more mid term risk cuz we are due for a marketwide adjustment that will have huge consequences across all verticals... but since credit usage is in tune with other major market factors, and at an all time high right now, short term it will lead to more revenue with the ability to ride out future market forces and be positioned if and when the market corrects to have offerings tailored to the needs of the additional added subprime consumers.

In short, I think its drop is a huge overreaction. Ally's stability is good enough to ride out any recession due to the fact that they are primarily an online bank with extremely solid financials.

I am betting it will return to its predrop price within the next month. $33c 3/20",t3_f79ki8,20
