The avalanche of actual idiots selling because of circuit breakers and bad articles and whatnot is 10/10 retarded. There’s no reason you can’t hold. I get that some of you have never had gains so high (shit, I haven’t - I could’ve had a heart attack because of premarket gains) but the fact of the matter is, if you HOLD now, you will BENEFIT later. 

This is a shout out to the real gods in WSB holding the goddamn line and seeing through the scare tactics. We all need to have DFV hands up in here. Don’t be the guy that got scared of a little loss. Don’t sell your positions. You’ll regret it one day. 

There’s still shorts to squeeze, guys. It isn’t over. Hold on tight, and actually believe. Go take a walk. Pet a dog. Cook some food. For fucks sake, go do something other than stress about shit you can’t change - highs and lows are going to happen whether you’re staring at your phone or not. 

Take a break, kings and queens. Rest up. The war isn’t over. Don’t fuckin sell, and if you do, don’t bitch when GME hits the hundreds.

1611612753.0,2021-01-26,wallstreetbets,gkrafqu,"To everyone who doesn’t understand GME

To everyone who doesn’t understand GME and what’s happening. Right now, GME is the highest ever shorted stock in history. Every day that we see green, the squeeze goes on.

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company.

2 questions - why and how.

The how is easier to understand so let’s start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much it’s going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they don’t want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on.

I’ve touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterday’s... every day.

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you.

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that.

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong.

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life.

NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow.

We have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently.
I am not a financial advisor, do whatever at your own risk 
Best of luck my fellow retard.

I finally handed in my notice to the boss this week. I spent 6 years here (5 of which were pretty miserable), my first professional job. Overlooked for promotions, no chances to advance, no respect. The pay was fantastic but the place is a textbook example of a toxic work environment. The problem was that I couldn’t (read: didn’t want to) leave. After years of therapy to address the paralysis coupled with perspective from corona, I finally got the courage to find a better job and gtfo.  

Throughout the years, I fantasized about all aspects of the day which I would finally flip the proverbial finger to my shite boss and quit. Well... here it is.. No fireworks, no parade. Just a calm awareness and appreciation that a rather complicated chapter of my life is finally closing. :’)

Thats why they manipulate the market to scare weak hands into selling hoping to crash it. Which ultimately backfired because they now lost $4 Billion and diamond hands went up +20% for the day.

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.
