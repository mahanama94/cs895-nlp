You are smarter than everyone else. Don’t do what they all say to do. The majority of people don’t beat the market.

Leg into a position of the course of a month. 40% week 1, 30% week 2, 20% Week 3, 10% Week 4

Wait for sad days to start legging.

NEVER open a position at market open. Wait until 10:30am. Close position spikes at market open.

Never try and catch a failing knife. If you missed the big spike, then move on.

But-to-open calls/puts with a 3 month timeframe to minimize theta exposure. Close between 30-45DTE

Do not buy-to-open, long-term option contracts before earnings, volatility is too high and the theta decay will most likely burn you.

Sell-to-open options on volatile and liquid stocks with a high IV Rank with 30-45 days till expiration and close at 10-21 DTE respectively 

Close at 50% if before 1/2 the DTE for max profit per day

Invest profits (from long and short positions) into a fund like SCHW for each quarter

Sell-to-open calls against your long calls and LEAPS (PMCC) at 90% probability with the minimum strike being the breakeven of the LEAP

Buy a SPY LEAPS if you fuck up. Sell PMCC against your SPY LEAPS. If you have under 25k, just trade SPY LEAPS and do PMCCs. Open 1 per quarter if you can afford it. Close at 50-100% gain",t1_h3e4e4k,23
