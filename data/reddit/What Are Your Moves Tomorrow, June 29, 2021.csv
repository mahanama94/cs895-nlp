1624914471.0,2021-06-29,wallstreetbets,h3d6o05,"Gosh what a day. Successful trades included unloading 15k shares of PSFE for a modest 2450.38 gain (at 12.74), closing a small MVIS short position of 2300 shares at 17.51 for a 492.36 gain, getting in n out of VIPS with 200 shares bought and sold for a 355.19 gain, quick flip of GME 60 shares in n out for a 219.68 gain, a hit on RUN 200 shares in n out for a 547.97 gain (probably bailed a bit early on that one, but - ah), a big missed oppo on MSTR because I pulled the pin at 579.10 on 60 shares for a 660.26 gain only to watch that fucker moon, stuck my nose into VUZI briefly with 500 shares and pulled out 342.58 gain, and then popped in n out of BIG for a lil 227.73 in the bank.

All in all a damned fine day and June has realised gainz of 68 777.54 so far. Mmm luvverly.

Went back into PSFE though and now bagholding 10k at 12.52. Bit worried as I know this thing could go pear at any moment...also reopened a short position on MVIS, -3300 at 17.91 (for a time my broker, Tiger, had no MVIS available to short). Not worried about that one, should pay in the next few days...hopefully not weeks!",t3_o9s4kb,8

1624931310.0,2021-06-29,wallstreetbets,h3e4m6z,"Options Trading Rules:

You are smarter than everyone else. Don‚Äôt do what they all say to do. The majority of people don‚Äôt beat the market.

Leg into a position of the course of a month. 40% week 1, 30% week 2, 20% Week 3, 10% Week 4

Wait for sad days to start legging.

NEVER open a position at market open. Wait until 10:30am. Close position spikes at market open.

Never try and catch a failing knife. If you missed the big spike, then move on.

But-to-open calls/puts with a 3 month timeframe to minimize theta exposure. Close between 30-45DTE

Do not buy-to-open, long-term option contracts before earnings, volatility is too high and the theta decay will most likely burn you.

Sell-to-open options on volatile and liquid stocks with a high IV Rank with 30-45 days till expiration and close at 10-21 DTE respectively 

Close at 50% if before 1/2 the DTE for max profit per day

Invest profits (from long and short positions) into a fund like SCHW for each quarter

Sell-to-open calls against your long calls and LEAPS (PMCC) at 90% probability with the minimum strike being the breakeven of the LEAP

Buy a SPY LEAPS if you fuck up. Sell PMCC against your SPY LEAPS. If you have under 25k, just trade SPY LEAPS and do PMCCs. Open 1 per quarter if you can afford it. Close at 50-100% gain",t1_h3e4e4k,23
