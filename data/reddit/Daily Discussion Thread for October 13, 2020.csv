1602596841.0,2020-10-13,wallstreetbets,g8owxoe,"Quick story time: I‚Äôm missing my right arm due to a car crash when I was young. When I was in high school, I had the opportunity to be a Senate Page, which meant that I got to work on the floor of the Senate. 

The best thing that ever happened there was an interaction I had with Senator Inouye of Hawaii. Now, you need to know that we were under strict orders never to bother Senators unless they spoke to us first. So we were all meek and sheepish around them. 

Anyway, my best memory was sitting at the rostrum on the Senate floor, and Senator Inouye flagged me over.

I rushed up to him, thinking he needed something, and he says, ‚Äúyou know how your arm still feels like it‚Äôs there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes senator‚Äù

‚ÄúThat feeling never goes away, your arm just feels shorter as you get older. I‚Äôm old now and it feels like my hand is right here.‚Äù He motioned to the end of his stump. 

Before I could respond, Senator Dorgan from my state walks up and says, ‚Äúwhat are you boys talking about?‚Äù And Dan Inouye looks at him as serious as can be and says, 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a one arm thing, you wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù 

Dorgan was speechless and just sort of wandered away. Inouye is still my hero for that. Just remember, if you ever do become rich and powerful, treating those around you with humanity can be life changing to them.

I didn‚Äôt ever want to be an amputee, but with just a few words, Senator Daniel Inouye initiated me into an exclusive club and I‚Äôll never be able to thank him for that small act of kindness.",t3_jaaj59,45
