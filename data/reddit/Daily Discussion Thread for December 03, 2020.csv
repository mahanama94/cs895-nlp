""The valuation..."" *crunch* ""makes...."" *crunch* ""NO.... "" *crunch* ""SENSE!"" he roars with maniacal autistic glee.

TSLA struggles for the edge of the ring, but coughs blood as each hit lands, and eventually stops moving. Bear King Burry drops the chair.

*Bear King Burry turns to the crowd*

""Was this your champion!? Was TSLA supposed to be your *chosen one!?*""

*A child in the crowd turns his face into his mother's side and cries.*

On the side of the ring WSB can barely move. TSLA was supposed to tag them in, but couldn't make it to the side in time.

""Get up TSLA"" WSB whimpers hopelessly, a single tear rolling down their cheek. ""Get up...""

*Bear King Burry turns to WSB*

""Now it is your portfolio's turn. Get in here you little bitch.""

""Excuse me."" Someone replies from behind BKB. ""I believe I can give you the fight you want.""

A robed figure is administering smelling salts to TSLA. The figure puts TSLA on its shoulder and carries TSLA gently out of the ring.

""And just who the fuck do you think you are?"" BKB rumbles ominously. 

BKB's fingers squeeze so tightly on the chair that metal bends.

""Who am I?"" the robed figure inquires.

*The robed figure stands straight and stretches to their full height. They must be at least 7' tall.*

The crowd stops crying and watches in stunned silence.

""Who am I?"" The figure repeats menacingly.

*The figure turns around to face BKB, ripping off his robe. A gleaming light fills the stadium. Before us stands a Golden deity, rippling with muscle. If there is an ounce of body fat it is currently in hiding, only to make way for seemingly endless coiled golden musculature.*

The figure looks directly into Bear King Burry's eyes.
