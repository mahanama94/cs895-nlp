The entire drive into the office I was expelling the most vicous ass gas of my life. Seriously corrosive stuff. A couple hours into the work day I had a meeting in a different building across campus. I was running a bit late and decided to drive to the meeting. I ran into a much more senior coworker that was heading to the same meeting and he asked me if he could hitch a ride. It was mid August and in the middle of a heat wave. At this point of the day my car had been sitting in the hot sun baking for a couple hours. We got into my car  and it smelled as if we had just climb inside my ass. He didn't say anything but I saw the pain in his face. He cracked  his window and we made small talk.
