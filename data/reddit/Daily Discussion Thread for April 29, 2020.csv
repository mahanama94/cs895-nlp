>  
>(Bloomberg) -- While futures got all giddy over Remdesivir headlines, GDP was published with a delay, showing a fairly weak state of play for the economy in 1Q. Growth was somewhat worse than expectation at -4.8%, but the primary drag was via horrible personal consumption, which collapsed by 7.6%. That was the worst quarter for household spending since 2Q of 1980 and sets a poor tone for the start of 2Q 2020. Capex was also fairly weak, with the lone bright spots coming from residential investment and net exports. If household spending fell by that much in 1Q when the economy was running as normal for 2 months, it raises the specter of a truly grim 2Q-though of course we all know it‚Äôs going to be awful, it‚Äôs just a question of by how much.

1588163042.0,2020-04-29,wallstreetbets,foy1mw1,"There's an interesting idea that comes from the design of robotics and animatronics. It's the idea that as a robot looks more and more like a human, people tend to report an increased fondness for the appearance of the robot. Robot looks more human, real humans approve. But just before a robot is completely indistinguishable from a real human being, it enters a stage where it is hated by people. Where the satisfaction with the robot's appearance plumets below even a highly unrealistic representation. So much so that robot designers often opt for completely inhuman representations to avoid this phenomenon.

This phenomenon is called the uncanny valley. 


This is mirrored in the investing of wsb. Where so many of us know nearly enough to make our portfolios look profitable, but end up with extreme losses while normies continue to make 7 percent per year in index funds and banks clean up.

The FED is cornered. They had their chance in 2010, but they just couldn't help themselves. Before Powell, in 2015, this poor woman was at the helm. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YAEHJvNscs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YAEHJvNscs)

One headline tied to this incident was that she suffered a mini-stroke while the US economy was on ""life support"".

In 2013 Ben Bernanke lied to congress when he stated that they had ""belts and suspenders"" and would be able to unwind the balance sheet soon enough.

[https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2013/02/ben-bernanke-testimony-we-have-belts-suspenders-to-unwind-balance-sheet-money-morning/](https://wallstreetexaminer.com/2013/02/ben-bernanke-testimony-we-have-belts-suspenders-to-unwind-balance-sheet-money-morning/)

He then proceeded to issue warning after warning about doing what he said he could. This was after he lied about subprime not being a problem. 

Does anyone really believe that this is temporary? That Powell will be able to wind down? 

I doubt it. 

So, what will happen when a nation prints trillions of dollars on a regular basis, to prop up their companies and stock market?
