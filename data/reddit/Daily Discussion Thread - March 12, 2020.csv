Example: SBUX - currently $63

Was $63 last January (2019)

We have a correction/virus scare drop that is currently only wiped out the past 12 months of bull run.

So, I understand why people are arguing SPY 240 soon.  Makes sense.

I also see why it can be smart to load up on LEAPS now, because I think the MARKET will return with a vengence because it's the best game in town for growing your money.

That markets will decline another two per cent, causing trading to end for the day. So what do you do now? As soon as the market reopens, you sell frantically, as do your peers, causing the seven-per-cent fuse to be tripped even faster.

That‚Äôs what happened in China on Thursday.
