Example: SBUX - currently $63

Was $63 last January (2019)

We have a correction/virus scare drop that is currently only wiped out the past 12 months of bull run.

So, I understand why people are arguing SPY 240 soon.  Makes sense.

I also see why it can be smart to load up on LEAPS now, because I think the MARKET will return with a vengence because it's the best game in town for growing your money.

I mean, what are you going to do, keep it in a fucking savings account for the next 5 years?

What do you do? Most likely, you sell madly, trying to get your orders in before the fuse is triggered and the markets are halted for fifteen minutes. In effect, you help cause what you are trying to avoid. Then, when the exchanges open again, what’s your single biggest fear? That markets will decline another two per cent, causing trading to end for the day. So what do you do now? As soon as the market reopens, you sell frantically, as do your peers, causing the seven-per-cent fuse to be tripped even faster. And once that has happened for the first time it’s likely to happen again. Investors will remember previous shutdowns, so if they’re leaning toward selling on a given day they’ll try to do so even faster this time, to avoid being caught out. That’s what happened in China on Thursday.
