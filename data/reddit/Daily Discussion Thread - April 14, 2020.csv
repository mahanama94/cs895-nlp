But... SPY is already back at Q4 2019 levels and barreling towards its ATH, and the economy is fucking closed, lol. Even if there is a vaccine tomorrow, it will take a long time for unemployment to recover, and middle-class liquidity will be down for the foreseeable future. The housing market will struggle, etc etc. There's no logical reason the market should be where it is. A vast majority of companies won't see revenues like Q4 2019 for a long, long, LONG time. And most analysts agree that shit was already overbought in q4 2019, anyway.

I'm lucky in that I am better off than many, and I don't have financial concerns about weathering this storm. But even I *know* that my spending, across the board, is going to be cut in half for the foreseeable future. I'm a business owner, and my contracts have dropped to 0. I don't *have* to, but I'll be cutting personal silly purchases, vacations, bars, restaurant spending, etc etc for probably a year or more. I was planning on buying a new car soon, but now I won't. I was planning on moving into a bigger place soon, but now I won't. 

A majority of americans are worse off than I am, and they won't be spending shit beyond bare necessities for a long ass time, and that's if they don't declare bankruptcy.

Even with the strong fed intervention, this makes absolutely no sense. I feel like this whole market is propped up by euphoria, like everyone has silently agreed that if we just pretend everything is ok, reality will catch up with the market eventually, and we all get to be happy, or some shit.

1586876027.0,2020-04-14,wallstreetbets,fndrcp9,">We have a strong, well capitalized banking system. - JPow on CNBC

Fucking bullshit. The researchers who wrote the autopsy on the 2008 financial collapse for the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission said:

>“For example, as of 2007, the five major investment banks — Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley — were operating with extraordinarily thin capital. By one measure, their leverage ratios were as high as 40 to 1, meaning for every $40 in assets, there was only $1 in capital to cover losses. Less than a 3% drop in asset values could wipe out a firm. To make matters worse, much of their borrowing was short-term, in the overnight market—meaning the borrowing had to be renewed each and every day…And the leverage was often hidden—in derivatives positions, in off-balance-sheet entities, and through ‘window dressing’ of financial reports available to the investing public.”

On April 5, JPMorgan Chase had $2.9 trillion exposure in off-balance sheet items versus $2.3 trillion on its balance sheet with $246 billion in equity capital. That information comes directly from JPMorgan Chase’s [Uniform Bank Performance Report](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=852218&peerGroupType=&supplemental=) for December 31, 2019 at the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Its off-balance sheet “mysterious” items marked simply “other,” total to a whopping $737.5 billion – that’s almost three-quarters of an undefined $1 trillion at the largest bank in the U.S.

Then there is Bank of America. It has $1.85 trillion in assets on its balance sheet and equity capital of $212 billion. But [off its balance sheet it has another $1.5 trillion](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=480228&peerGroupType=&supplemental=).

Earnings will be coming up starting end of April and throughout May for the sector. 

According to a Macro Voices guest, one of them - who remained unamed - will have higher earnings than their market cap this year if the situation persists. I expect this trade to be more hyped up as Mr Market comes to terms with just how long oil demand will remain soft. The cuts won't be enough to alleviate the inventory glut and tankers should be able to print for some time.

They are loaning out 4-5x all of their deposits, while you get fucked.

Also, since they can loan out shot loads of money, while getting sweet deals from the Federal Reserve, which is actually just their right hand masturbating themselves. While they scoop off the cum flakes from their stomach and eat them, you are accepting all the empty ball syndromes. You dont have any cum on your face or bank account.

This is because the name ""Federal"" in """"Federal Reserve"" is taking your 2 brain cells into a deep cave dive, and you think the Guuuuuuuhhhverment is doing their best. (To fuck you again like in 2008 to give the banks tendies first in the repo market.)

Also $1 does not equal 1 vote, as in McCain finance laws. $1 equals fuck you give the cc card companies 29.99% while letting them take cum at .00000000009 percent.
