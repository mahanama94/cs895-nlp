‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù My wife asked with dejection in her eyes. I couldn‚Äôt answer, so I rolled over in shame. I felt her get up from the bed, this time I faced her. Gathering her robe around her with tears in her eyes ‚ÄúI hope she was worth it.‚Äù She mutters as she whisks out the room.

I lay on the bed and arch my back as my body is rocked with an earth shattering stretch. I was back in the 737 with cotton candy clouds as I gripped the throbbing throttle and pulled.

3. They've both had successful raises recently.
2. Despite that 600% YoY increase in bookings article stretching the truth a bit, it strongly suggests people are eager to start traveling again after being cooped up for over a month. If we open in August, business will continue as usual. 
1. The Saudis bought an 8% stake in CCL. Y'all remember when we all used to think SNAP was going bankrupt back in October 2019--and we shorted the fuck out of SNAP? Saudis bought a 2.3% stake in the company. Look at where SNAP is today. No chance in Jahannam they'll let 8% of their cash burn to smoke.",t3_ghkxmf,6

1589200871.0,2020-05-11,wallstreetbets,fq9kjok,It's crazy I took a stab and bought 50 Wayfair shares at $27. Then it skyrocketed up to $130 and I said okay this is getting out of hand time to sell. Then they went up to $140 so I got triggered and bought puts. Then they went up to $170 and I bought more puts. $180 more puts. And now if the stock doesn't tank this next week I'll officially piss away more money on puts then I made originally.,t1_fq9k6so,15
