""Are you not a bear? Did you not fight the villagers?"" Asked Zarathustra. 

""Indeed. But many wore helmets and and they had tied their children to the fences with leashes and the children bit me and hurled insults as I ran.  I am still hungry""

""Weep not mighty bear"" said Zarathustra, ""for the people you encountered are disabled. Treasure them and love them for their time of hunger approaches.  Blessed are the retards, for in their greed they shall soon overextend themselves on SPY calls and overvalued tech stocks""
