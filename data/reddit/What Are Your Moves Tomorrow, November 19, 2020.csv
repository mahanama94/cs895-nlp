Palantir Announces Receipt Of Common Data Fabric And Data Security Solution Contracts From US Army

11/18/20, 10:38 PM
November 18, 2020 04:38 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) announced today it was chosen by the US Army to receive one of two prototype contracts for the Common Data Fabric and Data Security solution to support network design experimentation for the Army‚Äôs next network modernization set of technology, termed Capability Set 23.

This marks the first time Palantir‚Äôs Gotham software is being integrated with the Army‚Äôs latest mission command software application, called the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), making Palantir a key partner in accelerating the Army‚Äôs modernization. CPCE is now being fielded across the force, providing commanders with better visualization tools, common applications and new server infrastructure. The prototype will work at the intersection of intelligence, mission planning and execution, providing a single, integrated solution to give commanders a global operational picture to make better data-driven decisions.",t3_jwoge4,20

But how do lockdowns help us you may ask?  Shutting down the business capital of the world will be the catalyst used to finally pass the next trillions of stimulus in the forms of direct payments into the hands of the people, and another round of PPP.  All this money will be plowed back into the equity markets like last time, and we'll have the asset price inflation required to send SPY 400 EOY.
