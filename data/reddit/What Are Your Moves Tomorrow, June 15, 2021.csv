It keeps lots of recent comments in memory (a few tens of thousands) and compares all new comments to the old ones, so in effect we've got a soft ""r9k"" setup from 4chan where your comment has to be sufficiently unique within the last couple days to not get auto-spammed.

It'll catch a lot of reddit-isms like ""this is the way"" and short questions but it might be worth it. Gonna keep tuning it to try to capture memespam and short ticker/emoji spam.",t3_nzvijb,1

Everyday look at the WSB daily thread and see which ""undervalued"" ticker with ""high short interest"" is being pumped in here. Don't buy the ones that have taken off already, buy the ones that are barely up, but are picking up steam in the daily thread. **Don't hold for more then a day or two,** take profit, at open - 30 minutes after open the day after a big pump. (Like WOOF, today it had a huge run up, and it likely will in the morning, a sell off usually follows around open-10 A.M.

1623701558.0,2021-06-15,wallstreetbets,h1rp8zl,"1.	⁠Every analyst projects CLNE to be higher than it is. While the consensus is around the 20’s some say as high as 40.

2.	⁠Absurd play happening, if it closes above $13 on 6/18 an enormous amount of shares are bought

3.	⁠Great company overall, IE not a bag, constantly focusing on growth and gaining all kinds of new contracts.

4.	⁠Amazon is contracted with them at ~$13. Amazon is not in the business of losing money.

5.	⁠Two down days after a monster rally is nothing. If that is enough to chase you out, i genuinely don’t understand how you have any money left.

6.	⁠CLNE getting more mainstream interest from media due to positive environmental affect and major deals",t1_h1rnybo,8
