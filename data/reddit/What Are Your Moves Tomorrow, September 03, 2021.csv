Delta might not have tons of impact on the market normally, but it certainly has an impact on job growth. 

The ADP payroll report (which I'm aware hasn't always correlated to the monthly jobs report) missed expectations significantly. (\~350k jobs vs 600k expected)

Federal enhanced unemployment ends September 6th - I've seen this mentioned as a catalyst, but something like 26 states already ended this, and who's to say unemployed people suddenly get motivated to find a job a month in advance of losing benefits? IMO, they've already been looking for work regardless, and if there's a subset of unemployed people not motivated to actively search for work, they won't start looking until the free benefits are gone. 

The job market has also seemed to shift in favor of potential employees - based on what I've gathered, people are becoming more selective towards where they want to work (pay, work from home, etc), and the burden has shifted towards the *employers* to find work. I guess this (and most of what I mentioned) is anecdotal, but this all leads me to believe we'll get a bad jobs report = less risk of rate hikes/tapering = bullish.
