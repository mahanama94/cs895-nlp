It's me, Fuzzy. This is to let you know that if you post **anything** political that doesn't relate **directly** to markets in this thread (or elsewhere on WSB) the comments and/or posts will be removed and you may receive a ban. Keep WSB clean of your r/politics bullshit.

To the good, smooth-brained autists amongst you - if you see these, report them. I have a gap in my schedule for the next 60 minutes and I promise I will deal with them personally. Roast them in the comments (within reason). Do your bit to #MWSBGA

1587652768.0,2020-04-23,wallstreetbets,foaunfq,"Yup.  I went on a long rant about this the other day.  This completely stifles capitalism and even Darwinism.  Our country and humanity will suffer in the long term because of the Feds action.  Our country became so great because only the strong could survive and thrive in business over time.  Our capitalistic society forced us to innovate, adapt and ultimately grow better.  By bailing out failing companies you are doing the opposite.  You are not letting “natural selection” (in a business sense) play out.  The companies that have shown good fiscal responsibility over the years should be picking the bones of dying companies right now.  Instead we have printed trillions of dollars to bail out large, failing companies with obsolete business models only to prolong the inevitable which is their failure.  And where will most of this money end up?  Same place as always, in the pockets of the ultra rich, in one way or another.  It’s an absolute travesty and shows utter disregard for foundation our country was built on.  Trump is so goddamn fixated on keeping the markets up obviously for his re-election that he’s literally willing to do anything.  This isn’t about saving America or helping Americans.  It’s about trump being re-elected and the swamp going along with it and plundering America’s coffers once again.  I can’t imagine how the last two decades will be written in history books... imagine it’ll be something similar to the Roman Empire if we don’t make some significant changes soon.",t1_foaa3m8,21
1587645719.0,2020-04-23,wallstreetbets,foaffck,"Yeah it’s wild. It creates a worse form of uncertainty imo. By that I mean, people don’t understand how to value companies when the one’s with bad fundamentals get propped up (but only sometimes) and the ones with good fundamentals get left out to dry. 

I think this does explain the tech rally we’ve seen. Tech is the safe haven from the Fed’s bullshit. It’s one of the few sectors that’s not just growing, but growing at a rapid pace. So now investors are crowding in and pushing up P/e ratios to all time high or close to it.
