In both careers and relationships, to stand in strength, navigate with poise, and evolve with purpose, it is important to humbly acknowledge and respect endings when they come. Adopting a different vantage point with clarity need not invalidate the importance of past versions and visions; recognizing incompatibilities between characters, will, and ambitions while learning from past faults need not nullify the positive imprint that people have left on our lives. Not all ill-fitting pieces are bad pieces and even bad pieces are not completely devoid of positive projections. Some have allowed us to feel out our own edges, smoothed and strengthened them in the process of collectively trying to make things work. Disappointment, surprise, and grief do not negate the finality, inevitability, and weight of the conclusion, even though it is human nature to delay the admission as such. Things will rarely, if ever, end as a well-deserved deep and hard slumber on a perfectly supple bed of fresh linen, on the backdrop of an amber-crimson sunset bleeding itself indistinguishably into the baby blue skyline. Although, looking back, the lines of where it all started may have become blurry, the line of where things end should not be an arbitrary one. It should be decisive and intentional.
