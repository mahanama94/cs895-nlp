You guys should really do something about your security. My account was breached these past few weeks and I couldn’t do anything about it.

The hacker logged into my account and loaded up on 8/6 HOOD 70C calls yesterday when it was trading for $85.

This person knew my password, had access to my phone and my finger prints. The sick bastard even knew the name of my first pet and my mother’s maiden name. I know I couldn’t believe it either. He needs to be stopped.

HOOD is now trading at $51.24 and each of those contracts is worth $60 now from almost $3000 yesterday. Rent is coming up so I’m going to need my money back.

Thanks again,

I was doing laundry in my basement, and I tripped over a metal bar that wasn't there the moment before. I looked down: ""Rail? WTF?"" and then I saw concrete sleepers underneath and heard the rumbling.

Deafening railroad horn. I dumped my wife's pants, unfolded, and dove behind the water heater. It was a double-stacked Z train, headed east towards the fast single track of the BNSF Emporia Sub (Flint Hills). Majestic as hell: 75 mph, 6 units, distributed power: 4 ES44DC's pulling, and 2 Dash-9's pushing, all in run 8. Whole house smelled like diesel for a couple of hours!

Fact is, there is no way to discern which path a train will take, so you really have to be watchful. If only there were some way of knowing the routes trains travel; maybe some sort of marks on the ground, like twin iron bars running along the paths trains take. You could look for trains when you encounter the iron bars on the ground, and avoid these sorts of collisions. But such a measure would be extremely expensive. And how would one enforce a rule keeping the trains on those paths?

A big hole in homeland security is railway engineer screening and hijacking prevention. There is nothing to stop a rogue engineer, or an ISIS terrorist, from driving a train into the Pentagon, the White House or the Statue of Liberty, and our government has done fuck-all to prevent it.",t3_oyqh8q,11
