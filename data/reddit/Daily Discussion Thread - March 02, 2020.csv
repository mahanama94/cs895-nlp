That being said, and I don‚Äôt say this because I hate trump or am trying to make a political bullshit post, but trump trying to urge Powell into dumping more money into the markets is really starting to concern me. 

> As usual, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve are slow to act. Germany and others are pumping money into their economies. Other Central Banks are much more aggressive. The U.S. should have, for all of the right reasons, the lowest Rate. We don‚Äôt, putting us at a competitive disadvantage. We should be leading, not following!

As per Trump‚Äôs charge, maybe we *should be* leading the world, but not in cutting rates, but actually raising them. I‚Äôm honestly afraid trump either doesn‚Äôt understand true economic policy (hence his incessant urges to the Fed) or simply does not care about healthy economic policy.
