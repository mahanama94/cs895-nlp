They know they can't raise rates without bringing this shit down like Samson in the Temple. Even at 5% - lower than current CPI! - the Federal Government would need to spend over one trillion just on interest every year. That's over three thousand dollars for every person in the US per year, just on the motherfuckin' interest, and that's just for Federal Government debt.

Junk corporate bonds have lower rates than (the already cooked) CPI.

You saw the great news about getting back to pre-pandemic GDP? It took the Federal Government borrowing and spending around 20% of annual GDP just to get us to baseline. That *and* unprecedentedly low interest rates and muh QE. Ain't no such thing as a free lunch.

*Hurrddddurrrrd it's not inflation its just shortages* homie supply chain problems can be a sign of inflation.

Yes, asset prices could correct massively if the ""Federal"" ""Reserve"" eased QE and raised rates.... but guess what motherfucker? I don't think they will. They might bitch and moan and pretend that they are super duper serious and super duper gonna raise the rates for realsies, but they are probably just lying. Sure, it's possible they aren't, but look at what they do, not what they say. They know we are fucked because of inflation, but they aren't going to directly tell us so. It's inflation or massive crash and I think they've already made their choice. There is a reason Blackrock is ditching dollars to buy real assets.

Anyway I'm expecting around a 10-20% pullback sometime within the next half year due to evictions restarting, delta variant, and rate hike fears, but then we go half, if not full, Weimar. Huge paper gains will not keep up with inflation. Spy 800 by 2025, gold at 5k USD, silver in the low 100s, 15 dollars for a McDouble.",t3_owmjjx,9
