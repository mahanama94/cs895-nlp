1591282372.0,2020-06-04,wallstreetbets,fsv5x5f,"Stock Patterns
            
9:30 a.m.: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction (it may take a couple minutes to get going).

9:45 a.m.: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

10:00 a.m.: If the trend that began at 9:30 a.m. is still in play, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback 

11:15–11:30 a.m.: The market is heading into the lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a couple hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the market tends to ""drift"" for the next hour or more. 

11:45 a.m.–1:30 p.m.: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

1:30–2:00 p.m.: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in. 

2:00–2:45 p.m.: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into the close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, many traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stops closer to the current price.

3:00 and 3:30 p.m.: These are big ""shakeout"" points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.",t3_gwenjo,14

“You are playing with fire! You could lose everything!”

I legit told him I’m still going to do it because I trust my own guesses more than the stock market right now. 

He hemmed and hawed for quite a bit about it, until he asked why I have huge positions on FANG and DAL. They have been the [steadiest climbers](https://i.imgur.com/zVhOpRn.jpg) for me the last couple weeks. Now they are the only ones I’ve been trading that are up on futures. 

“You need to diversify and trade small to offset risk! I’ve seen so many people burned by the market!”

Dude. The market fucked everyone in March that wasn’t actively managing their own account. Even Warren Buffett got spooked and lost billions. 

I asked him what he is doing to invest right now. “Diversified ETFs” like fuck, can you just say you invest in the X sectors of the S&P like an honest thief and stop acting like it would be better for me to pay you to invest in SPY? 

Meh. I’m up 13% YTD, even though I went down 16% in March. I’m pretty happy with that. And if the stock market tumbles again, I’ve learned how to hedge positions with puts to not lose 16 fucking percent.
