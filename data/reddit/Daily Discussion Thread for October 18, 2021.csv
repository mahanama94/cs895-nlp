If they had any sense, they'd've discontinued the 'K' class overclockable processors 2 years ago so people wouldn't catch on.  But no, management and marketing is so divorced from engineering (what's left of it) that they still haven't realized that they're selling 'overclockable' chips that break when you boost them by 0.1 MHz.

The only real question, and it's a big one, is when the market will catch on.  Biden didn't help, invited INTC bigwigs to sit at a roundtable and came out with a whitepaper how American chip manufacturing is suffering and must be propped up at any cost.
