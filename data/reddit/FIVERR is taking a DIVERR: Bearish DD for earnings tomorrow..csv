Moreover, finding freelance gigs ANYWHERE else, including Indeed, Virtual Vocations, or other job boards is much more lucrative.

Then back and forth with fiverr customer service which is atrocious. Everytime you contact them its a different person and you have to re-explain the issue. Even when you reply to someone through the customer resolution section a new person responds. I ended up having to do a chargeback on my credit card and then both fiverr and the person I paid both sent threatening responses to undo the chargeback or else they would ban me from fiverr.
