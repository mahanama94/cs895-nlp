**EDIT**: I'm trying all kinds of creative ways to mitigate spam, don't get mad at me if your comments go missing though.

Which of you fools think UPST will pump again after lockup expiration. Allow me to pop your cherry and encourage any of you to proof me wrong. 

1. 60% plus of their loans are approved and financed by 1 shady ass bank (Cross River Bank) which also finances most of the loans for shitty fintech companies like Affirm & CoinBase. 

2. 65% of their referrals also come form one company (Intuit - INTU) via their Credit Karma platform. At any point INTU can decide to go in to lending and destroy little UPST. 

3. 20% of UPST is owned by one hedge fund (Third Point) they invested in UPST back in 2005 and they also own a large chunk of Sentinel One which is going public in the next month.  So if you think they won’t sell think twice.  Also with 20% ownership and only 50% of the outstanding shares able to trade prior to lockup well now you know how they drive to price so high.  

4. Lastly it trades at 45X Sales in 2020 that shit was allowed in 2021 the market is gonna smell blood and decimate them.",t3_nz4kgk,10

And she says ""guess what? I'm cheating on you.""

And you cry 

Then she says ""just kidding. I could never love anyone as much as I love you."" 

Then you wake up. It was all a dream. Of course no one could ever love someone as stupid as you. 

Then you wake up again! It was a dream inside a dream. 

Inception. 

It's all real. You're a millionaire with a big booty hoe who loves you for you.

I personally have been looking at for a long time, but the options only went to Dec 21. When I noticed they opened 2023 calls on it 6/4, I did buy 1 2023 $30 LEAPS for $14.00.
