I was delivering for doordash with a fucking master's degree for most of last year. I was regularly overdrafting my checking account and absolutely drowning in overdue credit card bills.

In January, I finally managed to scrape together a little bit of Doordash money to YOLO on GME FDs. It was the morning of Friday, January 22, about an hour before all hell broke loose and GME went from the $40s to nearly $80 in a couple hours. I turned $500 into $200,000, sold that shit at the absolute fucking top (lucky af) in January, and then bought back in again last week.

If this premarket action holds up, I am literally going to retire at 29 years of age. Unemployed deadbeat with a mountain of debt to multi-millionaire in under 2 fuckin months. Jesus.
