Dow trading at ( 25,035.0 ) +85.0 (+0.34%)


Global markets are in general trading in the range determined by past week and are currently in the lower end of the range, frankly the are eye to eye with their support

#____________________


Trade setup for today


#300 and 295 are one of the major area to decide next trend, if this break next resistance is directly at 275, but I am personally bull this week cause 300 support is too strong and would not like to underestimate


If it somehow manages to respect the support we can see 314 as an immediate target, the risk reward seems favorable

We won't be keeping stop loss for stocks but recommend a strict stop loss of 295 on derivarives with a view to hold through the week



Long term : Nasdaq not respecting it's 10k psychological support is a big red flag, we are planning to invest small quantity in quality stocks on this dip but are refraining to go big 

We are relatively flat for past 2 months, it appears we have transitioned from explansionary market to contracting market 



If I be honest, I can see no bull case or bear case on the charts, we are just playing a gamble by going long just because we are at the lower end of the range we are trading, I said this to be as transparent as possible
