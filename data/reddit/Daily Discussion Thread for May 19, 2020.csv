1589889486.0,2020-05-19,wallstreetbets,fr4ivr8,"Alright you fucking dipshits, last time I spoke about consistent small profits and hedging for newbies. Seems like some of you folks really liked it so I decided to post more cringe advice for you. 

Today‚Äôs Ted talk is about how to maintain your sanity trading in this absolute shit show of a market.

- Say you‚Äôre up bigly on a play and don‚Äôt know if to lock profits or diamond hands for a 10 bagger gain. Look at your all-time portfolio, remind yourself that we‚Äôre in the middle of a fucking pandemic with multiple countries heading straight into recession with a market waiting for a single bad news to drop dead and make the call. Personally I lock in profits when I‚Äôm up over 40% on a play but it‚Äôs your money so you decide what‚Äôs a better profit lock % for you.

- Betting on current market trend is a YOLO. Let‚Äôs say SPY(or any other ticker for that matter) has had a +2/3% day today and you‚Äôre anticipating it to go up further, buying more calls is a YOLO because you‚Äôre buying inflated option contracts with a gamble that it climbs further. So be wary before placing a bet that it can be wiped off very quickly if shit hits the fan. Many newbies don‚Äôt know this but VIX calls are an amazing hedge when you YOLO into SPY calls during rallies like a retard. Surprise Intra day dumps will fuck with your peace of mind and force you to panic sell if you don‚Äôt have insurance(VIX Calls) - having VIX calls will keep you in the game longer and they‚Äôre a fuckton cheaper than SPY contracts.


- Betting on opposite market trend on the other hand should never be a YOLO and you should start by building a position that is resilient to small price movements (for you dumbfucks who don‚Äôt know that means I‚Äôm saying that you should build an opposite trend position either 2 weeks or a month out so you don‚Äôt get fucked by Greeks). Let‚Äôs say SPY has been rallying for days in a row and weekly SPY puts are dirt cheap. I know a lot of you autists will yolo into weekly puts and then bitch about how the market is fucking retarded when the rally continues and your puts end up toast. It‚Äôs fair to be agitated but it‚Äôs better to smarter and start building a monthly put position slowly averaging in depending on how the market is behaving. You can be even more smart and get slightly OTM weekly calls(weekly calls that are +5/8$ are dirt fucking cheap for SPY) to hedge against the loss that your PUT position will be bleeding in the long run if the rally continues and give you a decent chance to exit if you feel the play is no longer at a good strike price and allow you to roll-over to a better strike price.

- Saved the best one for last. LEARN TO FUCKING ENJOY THE GAINS YOU MAKE BEFORE YOU FUCKING YOLO IT AGAIN YOU GREEDY FUCKING BASTARDS. 

I was up 8K yesterday due to the rally. My portfolio is still down 7% overall. I was up 177% in March but got greedy and took a huge hit being stubborn holding SPY puts and ended up being down 22%. After I closed my calls yesterday I rolled over a small capital back into some contracts. Of the 8K I made, I put 2k back in the bank and bought a bunch of stuff that I‚Äôve been meaning to buy and it felt so fucking good. I‚Äôm not saying material goods are the road to happiness but I‚Äôm pretty certain over 99% of you fucking dopamine whores wouldn think twice before buying a 50$ hoodie/200$ sneakers or whatever dumb shit you‚Äôre into but you would rather FUCKING YOLO your gains immediately like the autistic fucks you are before doing something good/buying stuff that you‚Äôve wanted and lose it all before enjoying the gains that you worked for. It‚Äôs beyond fucking crazy, I was like that too. 

But what‚Äôs the FUCKING POINT OF ALL THESE GAINS IF YOUVE BECOME SO FUCKING INSENSITIVE AND DONT EVENT BOTHER ENJOYING IT?

Thats all folks, thanks for coming to my Ted talk. Will post more shit when I‚Äôm in the mood.

Good luck today, let‚Äôs get them tendies.",t3_gmlsuw,59
