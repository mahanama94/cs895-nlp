Lived through a prolonged low and slow meltdown.  Saw money just falling away.

But I clutched my bags tightly and cried myself to sleep.

Certain digital coins would rise in value, the amount of these mined by RIOT would increase significantly, but the share price would nonetheless continue its ride down. 

On Friday, I finally started to give up.  I did not sell any shares, but I sold covered calls on a significant portion of my holdings.  Deep ITM covered calls.  Basically, an exit strategy where I get burnt but not as bad as it could be.

Today, RIOT volume is... let's just call it elevated.  Nearly 4 million shares have been traded in the first hour of trading.  The price is already up over 6% on the day.  My covered calls?  Already down about $4k on the day.

RIOT looks like it may go into orbit.
