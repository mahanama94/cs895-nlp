1631750900.0,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,hd0ncfl,"> As of June 30, Evergrande had 240 billion yuan ($37.3 billion) of debt due within a year, down 28.5% from the end of 2020 but nearly triple its cash holdings of 86.8 billion yuan ($13.5 billion), according to a company financial report.

> On Sunday, about 100 people who invested in Evergrande debt through ‚Äúwealth management products‚Äù sold by banks crowded into its Shenzhen headquarters to demand repayment.

> The company said those investors can choose to be repaid in property, cash in installments or a claim to payments on residential units, according to the business magazine Caixin.

1631761074.0,2021-05-23,wallstreetbets,hd18q1q,"First, applaud OP for this solid DD.  Lots of good comments here too.  I have YANG shares, YANG 1/21 $20 and $25 calls, and have 3/18 $22 puts on HSBC.  YANG really only goes up if there is a panic across the market, contagion effect across the rest of China's economy (everyone who's worth is tied to real estate assets which will sink, and those who put down $50-200,000 for an apartment and never even got it delivered and have lost all their money and also don't have a home are going to be less likely to buy discretionary goods), or a great capital flight out of China by foreign investors.   HSBC is just a wild ass guess. 

Second, agreed that a real estate melt down is worst case scenario for CCP, for all the reasons you've pointed out. 

Third, earlier today a fellow WSBer in London noted HSBC had emergency conference call.  HSBC was one of the top 4 mortgage lenders to the people who were buying Evergrande properties. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/hsbc-halts-mortgages-for-evergrande-projects-in-hong-kong It seems like a lot of these properties were never finished, and probably will never be finished.  We have no way of knowing what HSBC's exposure is, for now.  The other 3 major mortgage lenders were Hang Seng Bank (HSNGY), Bank of East Asia (BKEAY), and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) (private).  I have not done any DD into HSNGY or BKEAY.

Fourth, we know that as of spring 2021, Citi, Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America were drawn to China ""like moths to a flame.""   
[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3125723/five-big-us-banks-drawn-strong-economic-performance-moths](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3125723/five-big-us-banks-drawn-strong-economic-performance-moths)  Goldman had put $17 billion into China in 2020, and collectively those 5 had $78 billion in exposure for 2020; and it was growing at 10% per year.  In other words, Wall Street went brrrrrr and put it into ""broad array of cash and financing to companies and government entities"" in China.  You can't put like $85 billion into China without it being lended directly to Evergrande, construction companies working for Evergrande, other real estate deals propped up on inflated values, suppliers and vendors of Evergrande, or into government entities which will be indirectly impacted by Evergrande.  Again, we do not know what each bank's current exposure is.  

Fifth, this is all speculation, but we know Deutsche Bank has an appetite for the trashiest shit imaginable.  It has been facing [increased European regulatory pressure](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/deutsche-bank-may-face-higher-capital-bar-leveraged-loans-bloomberg-news-2021-06-22/).  But surprise, surprise, in April 2021, [DB became the first Eurozone bank to be allowed to be a primary dealer](https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210430-people-s-bank-of-china-approves-deutsche-bank-china-as-qualified-primary-dealer-in-open-market-business?language_id=1) for the Chinese central bank.  Now, why would the CCP decide to allow DB to be the preferred Eurozone bank?  It can't be because of transparency and stability and DB's decades-long reputation of adherence to strict regulatory structures.  

The thing to remember is that this could happen very fast, or it could still take another year to materialize.  Even if Evergrande can't make payments on September 20, we may not know which financial firms or other parts of the Chinese economy are impacted for weeks or months.  Our hindsight bias makes us remember and focus on September 15, 2008 with Lehman filing for bankruptcy and the rapid unraveling of the U.S. financial system the following week.  But things had been brewing since 2006 (home prices started to falter in some regions), October 2007 there were significant subprime delinquencies and foreclosures, Bear Sterns wasn't defunct until March 2008, and then Lehman, AIG, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Merrill Lynch, etc. in September 2008. 

TL;DR: YANG shares, YANG 1/21 $20 and $25 calls, and HSBC 3/18 $22 puts.",t3_pp1obi,135

I will say that the market has been prepping for this WAYYY ahead of retail. Look at the uptrend on YANG since February - you only see that on leveraged ETF‚Äôs when everyone and their mother is thinking the same thing.

And more importantly - saying that Xi needs to print $300 Billion and artificially procure 2% of their total GDP is pretty disingenuous. All those liabilities don‚Äôt come due tomorrow, or even in the next few years - the CCP would only need to drum up cash for them to meet payments on time and ensure creditors that they‚Äôve got it handled, not settle entire debts at once.

China is kinda screwed and deep in the water but the fact that their property is leased by the state lead to this outcome in the end. Evergrande [too] aggressively tried to capitalize over the last couple decades, constantly buying up land to develop it or sell as an investment and here we are today, where their bonds halt trading and are on notice to default.

HOWEVER, that doesn't mean CCP is gonna sit on the sidelines and watch their top two land developers go tits up. They will step in and bail out the debts or figure something out.

OP's bear case are also extremely cherry-picked and manipulated to support his thesis when it's actually the opposite - everyone and their mothers know about Evergrande's internal problems right now, it's being reported worldwide daily for weeks now. CCP stepping in and taking the property under state once again might be a hassle, but its gonna be a helluva lot less work than dealing with an economic depression. It will likely be spun to restore faith in CCP again and people will buy that shit up, trust me. All of you China stock bulls are at the helm, ready.

I'm always down to short China but Evergrande might be an extreme bull run opportunity after all the bleeding that Chinese stocks had in the last month. Tread with caution. CCP will not let a real estate company crash their economy of all things coming out of this pandemic.

The provincial CCP operate financially somewhat independently from the central authority in regards to paying their way. The way they do this is by selling their land in batches through outfits like Evergrande. This is how they have paid for everything for the past couple of decades, roads, schools, administration, etc. 

Couple that with the Chinese population not trusting banks nor stocks, and being told that real estate is the only safe place to put their money, and you get people talked into 2nd, 3rd properties absorbing most of their income, buying into huge shady projects of ghost cities where nobody lives, and all of this in a demographic situation that has begun a serious collapse. Their retirement age population is ballooning while productive age wage earners are contracting. The second/third child policy efforts came too late, and inflated prices and poor social policies make having children overly/impossibly expensive for many. 

The only reason it's gotten this far is rampant corruption and absurd amounts of leverage. The 'assets' of Evergrande are mortgaged to the absolute tits, like they are across the majority of real estate companies in China.
