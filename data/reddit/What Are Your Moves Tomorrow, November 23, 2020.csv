I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. That's when the joy left. That's when hope left.

I'm not a religious man, but I sometimes allow my mind to slip away into more pleasant things. I imagine holding her again. I run my fingers through her strawberry-blonde hair. I don't believe in the afterlife, but pretending makes me feel like me again, if only for one fleeting moment.

I turn on my neuralink and close my eyes. I flip through old pictures. It's her. I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.

I open a browser and check SPX futures.

It hasn't moved in decades now. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days. When I was happy. When she was here.
