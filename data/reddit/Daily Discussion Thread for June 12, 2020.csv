Sell your calls on open (if we stay elevated like this) and wait an hour to see which way things are going to go. Who cares if you miss 50 bps or even 1% in the grand scheme of things? The flip side is that you could be quickly cleaned out of your 6/19 calls on a 3% drop.

Yesterday was so damn ugly there will be residual fear and if there are some sellers, things could get red again fast.

I have nothing against you bulls and I want to help. I'm not saying go short. I'm not saying don't buy calls. I'm just saying don't buy dumb calls and maybe wait an hour to see if we are going to get raped again before you buy.
