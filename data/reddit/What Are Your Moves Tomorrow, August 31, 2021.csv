They put like 100 of us in a tiny room, and they asked us to wear masks, but legit 80 of the jurors were morbidly obese and went to the vending machines and bought chips and coca cola and immediately took off their masks to eat. Like 10 fucking minutes in. 

Then they just kept buying coca colas. They literally could not go 2 minutes without taking a sip of coca cola. I had to sit there and listen to these fat fucks smacking on lays all day.
