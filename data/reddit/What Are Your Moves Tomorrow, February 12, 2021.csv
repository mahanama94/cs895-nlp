P.S. There was always this much spam, the only difference is you can see it now. No rules were changed.

I figured I'd add comments to automod so people could see the absolutely insane amount of comments that get removed. Apologies for any spam this is causing. If the flood of new / low karma users keeps up, this will be temporary.

Also, every single automod removal should now result in a comment being posted explaining why.
