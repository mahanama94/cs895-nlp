However, with bonds so expensive they know that if a crash materialises much of the liquidity will be drained not only from equities but also from bonds. As bear JPOW said last week (remember retards?) they don't want liquidity to drain from bonds as this may cause trouble even for solvent companies to refinance their debt. This message by the FED is pretty much a ""if things go wrong please go into bonds, we got your back"".
