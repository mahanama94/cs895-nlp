How the fuck is this company allowed to exist with a bullshit product like 'credit scores' that they don't tell you how they calculated it, nor allow you to access without giving permission to have your asshole spread wide open for their 'business purposes', and yet it has so much power over your life? 

The agreement is also filled with all sorts of legalese bullshit.  Whenever you see words in an legal contract that are capitalized, it is often a way to sneak garbage in, because a capitalized word can mean anything the writer of the document wants.  For example, if I write a contract stating that ""You hereby agree to purchase the Dog for $200"", I could define 'Dog' as my cat instead, and now you'd be contract bound to buy my cat because dog was capitalized.

It makes me think that I'm shallow, and maybe I am, but if you're twice my weight, and I'm not athletic by any means, we have some incompatibiity issues. It means that we're apparently going to be spending 3 times the amount I consider normal on food. It means if I wanna hike a nature trail just cause, it ain't happening. And most importantly, it means my secret stash of Oreos is gonna have to be a LOT more secret.
