1623103993.0,2021-06-08,wallstreetbets,h0ynrmq,I’m in CLOV but with the movement today and the last news of shorts being 40%+ I’d say conservatively $50-55 and liberally I’d say $100-130 if it goes perfectly with a gamma squeeze and a short squeeze. For me though I’m not a professional but looking at what AM  was able to get to I feel like this isn’t insane. However I believe it will require this week and next to really go off.,t1_h0yndyw,12
