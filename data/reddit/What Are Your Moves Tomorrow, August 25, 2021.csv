—$900 in 1DTE 445Cs cashed out up 110% at $1890  
—The $1890 was in 33 contracts of SPY 8/20 435Ps at .57 each, which I sold for $1.14 each Tuesday (after briefly being worth .20 Monday) at $3762  
--Last Friday, like right after we pumped past 441 and reclaimed the 20d sma, I bought 50 8/23 446Cs at .34 ($1700) and 60 8/25 448Cs at .34 ($2040) for $3740...I sold them up 100% on Monday morning, leaving me at $7500ish. In full disclosure, I left about $15k on the table by selling at 100%. Oof.
