You, like almost everyone else, made a fortune trading the big tech stocks. Among those you find your favorite race horse. You win almost every bet on this stock, and buying the dip always works.

One day the market suffers a correction and your positions take a hit. ""I'm long term positive on this company, I'll buy the dip and wait"" You say.

The day after that you wake up and it's a sea of red. Your favorites are declining over 3%. You say to yourself ""Now is the time to go in"". The stock keeps declining intraday, but you keep buying the dip, not realizing the huge position size you're building up.

The next day the correction continues. You've wiped out your initial gains and some more. You have no cash to buy any more dips. When the bell rings, your portfolio is utterly broken and so is your spirit.
