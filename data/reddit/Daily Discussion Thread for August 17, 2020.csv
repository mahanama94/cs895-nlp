Like literally KODK executives are the dumbest mfking people in the world.  The government was handing them a GOLDEN GOOSE.  They would have become wildly rich just riding it out long term, collecting their absurd compensation, and they would have resurrected one of the most recognized companies in the USA.

Instead, the fucking morons decided to award themselves some absurd amount of stock options right before the deal went public.  As if they needed to loot the place and bolt!  These guys were being handed a government contract worth billions of dollars!  And their response was to loot the fucking coffers!

They are going to get sued to absolute oblivion.  In fact, they'll probably go to jail.  It's like they couldn't wait a year for their 8 digit payouts?!  Fucking MORONS",t3_ibbhcu,32
