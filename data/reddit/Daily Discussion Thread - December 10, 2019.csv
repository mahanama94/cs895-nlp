>  
>By Richard Jones  
>  
>(Bloomberg) -- **Both the ECB and Fed meetings this week will play second-fiddle to** **China-U.S. trade developments, as** **whatever happens at that table will set the agenda for policy makers in 2020.**  
A phase-one deal, and avoidance of additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods Dec. 15, will mean that both central banks can keep policy as it is now, and take a wait-and-see approach for the near term. Further into next year, when more is known about trade, the Fed and ECB will be more in play. That's my response to the QOTD.  
For now, messaging from Powell and Lagarde will almost certainly be consistent with what we’ve heard already. Lagarde will emphasize the appropriateness of current monetary policy and will probably reiterate her call for additional fiscal help from EU governments. From Powell, expect the on-hold messaging in recent communications to feature in tomorrow’s statement and presser. He will reiterate the robustness of the U.S. economy, and also highlight the downside risks.  
With nothing new from the Fed and ECB, the market’s focus will be on trade. This has been the case for the past weeks and months, and won’t change this week.",t3_e8p94h,7

>  
>By Cameron Crise  
>  
>(Bloomberg) --   
>  
>For all of the event risk we’ve got this week and into the end of the year, the elephant that remains in the dealing room is the fate of the tariffs. While game theory often gets thrown around in the context of market scenario analysis, this time it’s actually appropriate as you consider what Donald Trump will decide. A couple of years ago we heard that trade wars were “good” and “easy to win.” Perhaps the president has been watching the early-80s classic “WarGames” on Air Force One, however, as the latest leak suggests that he’s decided not to escalate the trade war for the time being.  
>  
>Despite a busy calendar this week, including U.S. CPI, Fed and ECB meetings, and the U.K. election, it’s hard to escape the obvious conclusion that many financial assets are simply waiting on news on the tariffs scheduled to go into effect over the weekend. That’s hardly a breathtaking insight, but there are a few interesting features of the set-up that add some spice to how you need to think about things.  
>  
>Chief among them is of course the negotiating tactics of the president. There’s a popular belief that he doesn’t want to derail the stock market heading into an election year, and that is certainly understandable. An alternative approach might be to spend some of this year’s tasty 25% gain by implementing the tariffs this weekend and then kickstart a rally next year by waiving them in January or February as part of a phase one deal. John von Neumann would approve.  
>  
>The latest leaks, however, suggest that the obvious middle ground solution may also be the most likely-- a delay in the tariffs pending the outcome of future negotiations. For the game theorists and scenario planners out there, this hearkens back to the WOPR computer in WarGames, which after simulating multiple iterations of global nuclear war concludes that the only winning move is not to play. A key question in the event of a deferral is whether the implementation date is moved (providing another defined event risk) or left open-ended, which would expose markets to a 6pm tweet-quake on some random Thursday early next year.  
>  
>We’ve seen leaks before that end up being contradicted, so some circumspection probably remains in order. After all, a weekend decision (one way or another) implies jump risk when markets start trading again next week, and no one wants to be on the wrong side of a step up or down in pricing. A VIX of 15 or 16 looks elevated relative to recent realized volatility but is hardly excessive given the underlying uncertainty. The SPX 3135 straddle expiring on Dec. 20 is priced at roughly 53.5 points at the time of writing, giving breakevens of 3081.5 and 3188.5. Somehow the lower price seems closer, doesn’t it?  
>  
>Regardless of what markets think should, or even will happen, there’s likely to be something of an options decay payoff profile from owning risky assets this week. The longer we go without confirmation one way or another, the stronger the impulse will be to de-risk juuuuuuust in case. Of course, the other event risks over the next few days will also play their part in determining short-term price action; perhaps someone should send a “War Games” VHS tape to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue just in case.

>  
>By Eddie van der Walt  
>  
>(Bloomberg) -- **Impeachment headlines are nothing but noise from a markets perspective** as long as the Senate stands ready to acquit President Donald Trump. That was reflected in a lack of volatility in the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index and in global stock indexes as Democrats announced two articlesagainst the president.  
>  
>Traders won't care about any of this right up until they have to. The charges are coming from the House of Representatives, which is controlled by the Democrats, but the trial will take place in the Senate, where Republicans hold sway. You can expect markets to react if it looks as if Trump may be removed from office because he's losing GOP support. That has yet to happen. But if it does, the impeachment process would start influencing the policy outlook, and thus become a market theme rather than pure political maneuvering.  
>  
>Looking historically, the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton's in the middle of the 1990's dotcom boom didn't lead to a sell-off. In fact, the S&P 500 and MSCI ACWI both climbed during his trial. During the events leading up to Richard Nixon's resignation in the early 1970s, volatility across markets was higher, but there were other issues weighing on markets, including U.S. stagflation and an oil embargo.",t3_e8p94h,4
