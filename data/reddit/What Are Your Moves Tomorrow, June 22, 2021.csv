1624315071.0,2021-06-22,wallstreetbets,h2l86h9,"Anyone wanna brainstorm as to how we'd incentivize people to create DD for varying tickers and not more of the same? I was thinking maybe make a bot that rewards a DD post if it stays up for at least 24hrs with a subreddit-specific award that'd show in your little stats readout on the bot's DD replies and give you reddit gold. Y'know, like the pee martini, but different.

Or maybe a listing of DD auto-generated and put in the daily thread's description but it only picks the top performing DD for a ticker if it's got multiple DDs?

Any ideas? Think it's worth doing at all?",t3_o540ge,1

## Here’s what too look for in the markets:


The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. 

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”",t3_o540ge,21
