1617211951.0,2021-03-31,wallstreetbets,gsxqeqr,"President Joe Biden has unveiled an outline of his infrastructure plan, and it includes a proposed $174 billion investment in electric vehicles.

The Biden administration has released an outline of its infrastructure plan on its website.

It includes a $174 billion investment in electric vehicles that they summarized:

>*“Create good jobs electrifying vehicles. U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. He is proposing a $174 billion investment to win the EV market. His plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories to compete globally, and support American workers to make batteries and EVs. It will give consumers point of sale rebates and tax incentives to buy American-made EVs, while ensuring that these vehicles are affordable for all families and manufactured by workers with good jobs. It will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030, while promoting strong labor, training, and installation standards. His plan also will replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrify at least 20 percent of our yellow school bus fleet through a new Clean Buses for Kids Program at the Environmental Protection Agency, with support from the Department of Energy. These investments will set us on a path to 100 percent clean buses, while ensuring that the American workforce is trained to operate and maintain this 21st century infrastructure. Finally, it will utilize the vast tools of federal procurement to electrify the federal fleet, including the United States Postal Service.”*

Without going into details, the investment will include funds to help automakers secure materials for electric vehicle production and converting factories.

The announcement confirms that the initiative will also revamp the consumer incentive to buy electric vehicles.

Again without going into the details, we do have a confirmation that it will not only be a tax credit, but it will also be available at the point of sale, which is going to facilitate sales.

The summary also confirms that this incentive is only going to be for “American-made” electric vehicles.

Recently, Democrats have introduced several new legislations to reform the EV tax incentives and one of them, [the GREEN act](https://electrek.co/2021/02/26/more-generous-electric-car-federal-tax-credit-reform-being-proposed/), included a point-of-sales aspect.

Man, I loved checking in on WSB when it was low key, under 250k subs. It made me very rich and very poor many times. Most times I didn’t cash out near the top.
Ugh one time I showed my coworkers making 100k in a week, and 30k in a day.
Literally lost all 100k real quick, but now I’ve rallied up basically my whole workplace on GME.
I’ve changed two of my coworker friends’ lives.

Back when they missed out on me telling them about FCEL at .50, they listened to me for GME at $15.
One of the lowest paid employees is up 300%+ on her fcel, it’s hilarious, she’s a better trader than all the other car salesmen.
