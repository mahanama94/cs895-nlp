1. Coronavirus continues to spread at an alarming rate, however the news headlines stop caring because they have the memory and attention span of a goldfish. People regularly dying of coronavirus becomes a normal thing. People die every day and stonks don't care because they be stonkin'
2. However, stonks do care about earnings. I predict that most earnings *will* beat on revenue and guidance, yet they will still go down, much to the pikachuface of bulls. Guidance will still indicate an economic slowdown and remind shareholders that their shit is overbought. Massive profit taking ensues.
3. I predict the Fed will keep rates the same, and they will express a desire to gradually lessen their repo assistance and QE, so as not to cause an equities bubble. As the extra liquidity drains away, the market will snap back to reality and ope there goes gravity.",t3_ev46l5,14

The Good: Q4 revenue and sales absolutely will kill expectations. People could not buy enough fruit this past holiday season. AirPods were nowhere to be found, even the laptops and desktops were sold out lots of places. Anyone who didn‚Äôt already have an iWatch who wanted a tracking device also scooped one this past quarter.

The Bad: guidance will not be great, China has gone dark, no real upside from here in terms of innovation/hype until later this year.

I think IC is the way to go. 335/295 and just collect some premium if you really *need* to have money in the market on this one. 

If that‚Äôs too complicated for you and you want a simple upsies or downsies, *go with puts* because the market cares more about the future than the past and the outlook for Apple though great, will be uncertain at best in terms of trying to duplicate the Q4 EPS.
