At that time, most big companies didn't need the cash immediately but wanted the extra cushion just in case. And when some started doing it, the remaining companies joined them in the rush for cash. Which resulted in the March fast crash because of the huge liquidity crunch and sell off of everything, even safe haven assets.

If the story repeats with consumers, with most minimizing expenses and rushing to horde cash, it'll spark the depression in our consumer driven economy.

In my case, I put my loans on forbearance because it's worth paying the 1.9-2.9% interest accrual to improve cash flow in case things get worse for longer.

The mechanism to trade changes the underlying fundamentals how now?

1. Gold was linked to the dollar, not interest rates
2. We tied the dollar to oil via agreements with OPEC in the 70s

Again the concept isn't vastly different So you basically made the same point I did.
