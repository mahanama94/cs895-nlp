2019-12-02,wallstreetbets,f9fsrki,"Moments before the opening bell, u/Aidangamer28 anxiously grips his sippy-cup of coffee.  “Free Tendies”, he erotically whispers to himself.  He doesn’t know what to attribute his upcoming success to.  Perhaps it’s all those hours he spent researching stocks and options.  Perhaps it’s those vaccinations his parents administered to him as a child.  Regardless of the origins, he’s certain that he’s identified the glitch, and knows what he must do.

Like Neo from the Matrix, u/Aidangamer28 is about to take down the system.  His logic is solid, his penis is flaccid.  “1 minute to open”, he wheezes through clenched teeth.  His heart beating heavily in his chest reminds him that it’s good to be alive.  His hydrocephalic head pounds with the blood and adrenaline pumping through his body.  His penis remains flaccid.

At the same moment, Peter sits in his cubicle at the RobinHood corporate office in Menlo Park, California.  Like Agent Smith from the Matrix, Peter is tasked with ensuring that the glitch remains unmolested.  His palms are sweaty, his penis is also flaccid.  The risk-management team was very clear with their instructions, written in crayon and feces, “THIS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED.”

The stage is set.  The clanging of the bell signals the opening of the market.  This is bigger than Bulls vs Bears.  This is bigger than all of them.  This is peak autism. ",t3_e4xkju,59
