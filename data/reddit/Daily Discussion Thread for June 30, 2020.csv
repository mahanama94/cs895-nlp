Nikkei up 1.33%

Europe indices are trading in a flat range for quiet sometime just like asia

CAC 40 up 0.04%


FTSE down 0.51%


#_____________________


Dow (25,453) -44.0(-0.17%)   

Global markets are in general trading in the range determined by past week and are currently in the lower end of the range, frankly the are eye to eye with their support

#____________________


Trade setup for today

Similar like yesterday, thus same parameters apply


#300 and 295 are one of the major area to decide next trend, if this break next resistance is directly at 275, but I am personally bull this week cause 300 support is too strong and would not like to underestimate


If it somehow manages to respect the support we can see 314 as an immediate target, the risk reward seems favorable

We won't be keeping stop loss for stocks but recommend a strict stop loss of 295 on derivarives with a view to hold through the week



Long term : Nasdaq not respecting it's 10k psychological support is a big red flag, we are planning to invest small quantity in quality stocks on this dip but are refraining to go big 

We are relatively flat for past 2 months, it appears we have transitioned from expansionary market to contracting market 



300 being respected gives some confidence, but one thing we should not forget is that testing is not over and it might test this level again, please don't compromise your stop losses if long in this market

1593537239.0,2020-06-30,wallstreetbets,fwhs724,"I'm gonna give yall some info and see what you can do with it:

I work in various industries, the hottest of which right now is selling PPE, primarily nitrile gloves. These gloves are made of rubber and all are manufactured in SEA.

I cannot tell you how many people are making millions off of just brokering these deals. These gloves are the hottest commodity in the market. Starting tomorrow, the NHS is making a government bid to outbid all private brokers. The US government has already been putting out government bids. I regularly see deals worth hundreds of millions pass by my desk.

Rubber trees take around 13 years to grow. These materials are drying up and costs are getting even higher as materials decrease. I'm not smart enough to figure out all the tickers this impacts, just a heads up of a very real market shift globally that isn't going away any time soon.

Edit: As some have pointed out these gloves are also made of synthetic latex which is petroleum chemical based to my knowledge. Again, not sure where this all fits, just that I have never seen a market like this pop up and make billions for absolute random brokers with no experience in a matter of months, with no sign of slowing.

Edit 2: From this article:https://theglovecompany.com.au/hands-on-safety-blog/2018/nitrile-gloves-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers-faqs/

'...nitrile gloves begin their lifecycle from rubber trees'

Again I am no chemist. I am involved in this market, and I have been explicitly told from the folks I work with regularly that raw materials are waning. These factories are entirely based in SEA, and have been, allegedly, completely bought out or 'rented' by PE consortiums (I work with one) that are setting the market price.",t3_hikka1,10
