I was going to make this a separate post, but I figure here is just as good to thank our PRT soldiers in the field today. The solemn pride I have is the result of years work on my part to troll Robinhood, and point out how incredibly predatory their shitty, retard-bait app is on the tendencies of young autistic men like ourselves. 

When I was banned from Wallstreetbets for about 9 months a while back, I began posting my memes on Robinhood. The corporate, Californian, asshor licking ikemen they are - they wrote an email to the Robinhood subreddit team saying I wasn't ""inclusive"" enough or some shit. Which is bullshit, probably written by an Indian. Anyways they got me banned from my refugee subreddit and one month later I was back on WSB. 

To see our movement of truly retarded people, embodied by our Guh-d, CTN, take down this piece of corporate garbage gives me immense satisfaction. But to have it done via a blatantly obvious glitch, providing free money to arguably the most retarded and reckless people on Earth, brings me a sense of satisfaction that I cannot explain. I thank each and every one of you for your service. You have lived our creed, and fulfilled the promise of our shining city on a hill of other people's money. 

Yours sincerely,

1573072711.0,2019-11-06,wallstreetbets,f6q8fos,"Time for **Magical Crayons TA.**

As predicted [last Friday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dq9hiv/weekend_discussion_thread_november_13_2019/f61pyc4/) the technical correction was supposed to hit Nov 6-7. We hit right on time to the date which is spooky AF. We filled our most recent gap at 306.2 almost perfectly and recovered, which is a bullish sign. Again, if you're a bull you want these small pullbacks for continued running. 

We still haven't fully resolved the wedge (we're still trading in it) but because of strong buying I'm not sure how far the next drop is, if we see it at all -- the market is currently far stronger than I could have anticipated. If you wanted me to guess, it would have to be a collapse of 306 tomorrow which will push us towards 304.5, which will fill our most second recent gap. If we never see 306 by EOD tomorrow we have increasing support, which will mean that the 304ish level will be in the rearview mirror for the short term if a future drop does occur.

If we DO touch the 305 range tomorrow but trade between 307 and 305 for a day or two, it's good for bulls from a technical standpoint. Collapse of 304.5 is obviously a negative sign as we'd be heading towards neutral sentiment, which would put the current bullish trends in danger.

All in all, nothing technically has changed. Stonks still strong, market still strong, GUH still GUH. Continue onwards friends.",t3_dsespz,13
