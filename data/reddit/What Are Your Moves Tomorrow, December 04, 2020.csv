""Morgan Stanley is the lead left underwriter and IPOs led by the firm over the last 12-month period have generated an average return of 68.5% since their IPO. This is a top-tier performance for all major underwriters during the period.

As to valuation, compared to Palantir, which is admittedly an imperfect comparable, C3 is asking IPO investors to pay roughly half the Enterprise Value / Revenue multiple of PLTR.

Notably, C3 is growing revenue at a significantly lower rate of growth versus PLTR.""
