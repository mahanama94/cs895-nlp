#The Mango Contango:

- You are looking to buy mangoes next month. You have $100, and each mango futures contract is $10. You now have 10 mangoes you plan on buying, congratulations. 

- The month is about to roll over, and you realize ""shit I don't need these mangoes right now! I will next month, though!"" Bad news! Your contracts have gone down by $1, and are now worth $9, so you sell them to some fool for $90. Shame, you lost $10, but you're sure it'll bounce back.

- Well! Good news, or so you think... The contracts for the following months are actually worth $15 because there's expected to be a shortage! However, you only have $90 now... so you can only buy 6 contracts this time.

- You decide to hold on and see if you can make your money back. You wait another month. You were right! The mangoes futures for the *next* month have gone up EVEN FURTHER! $20! However, because you only hold 6 contracts now, you are actually only up $20 total, even though mangoes are DOUBLE what you originally bought the contracts for.

This is the mango contango. And this is how contango fucks your ass in USO. Enjoy!",t3_g4q8u6,48

These past two weeks have seen a massive flight into tech stocks as ""recession proof safe haven"" equities, hence the massive surge in AMZN, NFLX, ROKU, etc. 

SHOP is following the same trend. Why does $SHOP have particular retard strength? $SHOP is a Canadian company which is crosslisted on both the TSE and the NYSE. As a result its like AMZN for Canadian investors who are flocking to it as a safe domestic equity. 

Tax laws in Canada *strongly* favour investing in domestic equities so the $SHOP run up is essentially a Canadian parallel to the AMZN run, with the additional retard strength factor of it being a crosslisted favourite of domestic CAD investors.",t3_g4q8u6,9

""Watching  the May contract for oil futures this morning, I was shocked at the  amount of coverage given to ‚Äúoil‚Äôs plunge‚Äù Monday morning.  That may be  because I watch the May 2021 WTI futures contract, which has fallen  $0.18 per barrel to $35.34 in early Monday trading, not the May 2020  contract which has fallen an astounding $7.42 (more than 40%) to $10.84  per barrel and drawn all the headlines.  

The culprit here is obvious.  The United States Oil ETF, USO.

According to *Bloomberg*,  USO owned 25% of the outstanding volume of May WTI oil futures  contracts as of last week.  With that contract set to expire Tuesday,  there is an obvious long squeeze going on here. ETFs like USO are not  created to take physical delivery of the oil contracts they hold, so in a  long squeeze, the fund‚Äôs managers‚ÄîBank of New York [BK](https://www.forbes.com/companies/bank-of-ny-mellon)  Mellon is USO‚Äôs administrator and its general partner is U.S. Commodity  Funds, LLC (USCF)‚Äîhave to dump oil. That has caused the front-month  futures price to drop more than 40% today.  The June contract has also  fallen, to be sure, but by a much lower degree (it is now down  $2.37/barrel to $22.36.) That decline might be expected in the throes of  the worst pandemic to have hit planet Earth in the past 100 years.  There is no economic outcome that could possibly justify single-digit  prices for oil, though, and USO‚Äòs implosion has put the benchmark WTI  crude oil futures contract on the precipice of that benchmark today.""",t3_g4q8u6,9
