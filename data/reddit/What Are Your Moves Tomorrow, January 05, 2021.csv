1609809798.0,2021-01-05,wallstreetbets,gi4r1vg,"WSB wonks, what do you guys think we should do about this? Looking for ideas and opinions.

In the past we've periodically refreshed the ""list of tickers that are blocked by automod because they're worth less than 1 billion"" by hand. Someone generates it, we put it in automod, stuff is good for a while. People complain that we accidentally blocked FBI or something, we take it out. People complain that their favorite pennystonk is now over 1b, we take it out.

My bot now handles blocking tickers. It grabs 5 tickers every 3 seconds and has about 8k tickers total in the DB. That means that the list is more or less constantly being regenerated. It lags a bit but it'll be way fresher than it used to be. I thought that'd be universally seen as a good thing. That was short-sighted.

How do we deal with the fact that market caps tend to yo-yo around quite a bit? We've already got a case today where we're being accused of *hIdiNG tHe GoOd Dd* and manipulating (I don't know how hiding posts helps us make money, but ok) because the fact that we disallow something one day and allow it the next looks weird to the average paint-chip eater.

Do you think it's acceptable to have whether or not a stock can be talked about change daily like that? Do we try to do the great reset once a week and make a thread about it? Would you actually accept not being able to trade a market cap > 1b stock all week because the weekly WSB ticker ceremony hadn't hit yet? What happens when GME goes below 1b because a staffer starts yelling racial profanity on an earnings call? Does everyone start busting out the unicode and emoji substitutions to get around text filtering and we just accept it for stocks we like, or do we all swear it off like a bad girlfriend?

What do. Ol' Ted was right. Maybe we should return to monke.",t3_kqhtg5,41
