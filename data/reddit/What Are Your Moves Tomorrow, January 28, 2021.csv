All this insider trading, blatantly illegal shit ruining people's lives, blowing up worthless companies or shorting perfectly good companies into the ground was making me sick. I left and never looked back. 

I joined WSB for the memes but then found out you can easily sift through the wheat from the chaff. GME caught my eye and I went in for the money. I never expected this to happen. At this point it's no longer about the money for me, but sending a message. 

A family friend is a finance professor and he once said to me, ""hey you know what I like to watch? National Geographic. You wanna know why? To remind me what we are. We are all animals, the strong eat the weak, tearing the faces off those that cannot fight back. Don't ever forget that it's a cold hard world out there."" 

When 2008 happened who got arrested? Nobody. They kept repeating no institution is too big to avoid investigation but they did absolute fuck all. Top execs still got away with enough money to buy private jets. Money that was people's entire life savings. People that needed that money to survive, for medicine, for their children's education, for getting out of crushing poverty, to get out of the endless cycle of debt and compound interest. 

Now they have the audacity to call us criminals? What fucking hypocrisy. 

Stand with me now brothers. Stand with me and hold until they bleed out of every orifice. Send them a message that we will take this no longer. Either we fold and go back to the rich endlessly robbing the poor, or we stand our ground and say no, no more.

The shorts don’t have to close their entire position at once, they are most likely doing it in bursts as prices get driven down intraday.

If they can trigger stops and and get people selling they’ll buy on the way down to try to mitigate their loss on their positions 

Citron released a video talking about how they exited @ $90 today, if you notice earlier this week there was a selloff after it peaked @ 135, this can give them the opportunity to close out their positions. DO NOT SELL.

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

1611805065.0,2021-01-28,wallstreetbets,gl1lqjv,"To Explain Briefly, why you should hold

&#x200B;

So, Melvin capitol and other hedge funds short sold $GME. Meaning that they borrowed a certain amount of $GME Shares at a certain price. Their plan would be to wait until $GME price fell, and then to buy up at that lower price, pay back the shares they borrowed, and keep the difference.

 ie borrow (for example) 100 shares at (hypothetically) $20 a share and wait until it dips to... say... $15. they could then buy 100 shares at $15 return the 100 shares. Making a $5 profit per share($500) \[This of course is at a much larger scale than 100 shares\]

The one issue they have is they short sold over 138% of the $GME Stock. Meaning, there are 38% more shorts than there are shares... They cannot possibly buy the shares needed to pay their debt.

They can do their best to buy up all the stock, but as long as people hold/buy $GME the hedge funds will bid higher and higher, ***hypothetically*** it does not have a ceiling. 

this is all of course incumbent on the majority of people NOT giving up their positions.

Eventually, humans will be humans and jam the printer...

1. Ryan Cohen. He bought about 13% stake in GameStop and I truly think he could be taking them in a new direction. This man is an ecommerce genius and the founder of Chewy (which he sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion. He penned an open letter to gamestop (which I encourage you to read) where he made some very good points.

2. The squeeze has not squoze. Melvin capital received billions of dollars in bail out money from Citadel, and guess what they did. They doubled down on their short position. At this point, I think they're challenging our retard. And we've been retarded for way longer than they have.

3. Lot of shorts expire this Friday, forcing the price up up and up.

4. It's the highest shorted stock on the market. At 147 fucking %. The math is simple, if we hold, the stock goes up. 

5. This is your one chance to fuck the dudes who consistently fuck everyone else on a daily basis. Bleed these hedge fund bitch boys dry. Idk about you, but for me, this is personal.

6. We are winning and they are scared. Why else would they lash out like this? They know we have them cornered and they want us to fall apart. These autists think they are better than you and refuse to admit they fucked up big. They claim we need to be regulated for manipulating the market when it's the very thing their careers are built upon.

7. If u/deepfuckingvalue can hold, so can you.

8. We are literally making history. There will NEVER be another stock like this one.

9. Your wife's bf will be pissed if you sell, don't do that to him after everything he's done for you.

10. Apes together strong

11. WE LIKE THE STOCK

Demoralization - this is a process which can take about 1-2 days and one subreddit ban to perform (A complete fuckery). During this stage, the moral fibre and integrity of the retail investors is attempted to be put into question, thereby creating doubt in the minds of the people who saw a yahoo article about it, bought in, and paper handed when it moved 2 cents. To do so, manipulation of the media and markets is required to influence actual autists. As the bots, hedge funds and literal autists attempt to generate massive price drops, such as after market price dumps, the the tendie town retards and autists would slowly loses control simply through attrition. Again, true facts no longer matter during this stage, but rather creating perceptions of actual bandwagoning autists are of paramount importance.

Destabilization - the purpose of this step is to retain the status quo, particularly the retail investors economy, and defense systems (💎🖐)The intent is to create a massive government permeating society and becoming intrusive in the lives of the tendie making autists . This can take from one AH period to perform, again with the active support of bots and boomer media pushing the actual autists in this direction. Here, risks and warnings are whined about to the average joe autists to encourage their support for keeping us from tendie town . Basically, they are bribing the real autists to accept their programs.

Crisis - this is a major step and involves a revolutionary change of share price. This is where a cataclysmic event upsets and divides the retail investors thereby attempting to create panic among the autists. To retail investor retards and autists, symptoms would include circumventing the Constitution and the first amendment right to free speech, and altering the checks and balances of government, and possibly whining to the SEC

Normalization - the final stage is where the autists finally acquiesces and begins to assimilate Goliath fucking Davids wife. This is what we have to avoid.

This is the strategy we have to recognise and avoid. They are doing this intentionally to divide and crush our efforts at fighting back at those who have fucked us over for years. Those who brought our parents to tears and put our livelihoods on the line by gambling our entire futures back in 2008 while you were in a COD 4 lobby crying because a 35 year old Coomer called you a squeaker and said you were shit at the game.

“Stock manipulation carried out by random losers on the internet is never okay,” 15 senators said in joint statement. “The integrity of our markets is sacred, and should only be violated by US senators who got a really good tip about a hot stock.”

Most of the calls for regulation have come from the organized short squeeze of GameStop, which most senators did not own. “Unfortunately, none of us use this internet website called Reddit, so we will move to shut it down. The talented stock pickers from that site may move over to a hedge fund that’s well-connected to a senator,” the statement continued.

Before moving to shut down the r/WallStreetBets forum, senators called several users of the site to testify in front of a closed-door session of the Senate. Anonymous sources who attended the hearing said the focus of the questions was whether or not AMC stock will double again, and if the senators still had time to place their trades",t3_l6ea1b,125

Yall need to understand that there is no set time frame for the funds to return the shares, as long as they are paying the margin interest. That being said, brokers can force funds to close positions but this is an uncertainty. 

Bottom line is, as long as we **hold**, Wall Street is bleeding in margin interest until they give in. Nobody knows when that will happen, or whether that will happen gradually or instantaneously. What we do know is: the majority of shares have not been returned, so as long as we hold, the short squeeze **will happen**.

EDIT:

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Look up any normal company and see what normal borrowing fees are like (0.3%), GME borrowing is sitting at astronomical rates. Funds are bleeding just from margin interest alone, end game shouldn't be far away anyways. Please for all that is good: hold.

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

*If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fucking fantasy land.*

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

*If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.*

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future.

Copied this text by [u/saltystir](https://www.reddit.com/u/saltystir/) because it can't be said enough!!!

Let me preface this by saying that I like the stock, and this is not financial advice.

There is only one thing everyone needs to know: we are in a situation where profit is theoretically infinite. It’s just dependent on the psychology of the bag holders. Remember the hedge funds have to buy ALL shares after Friday, no matter the price, because that's what they agreed to.

The more everyone holds, and the more people buy, the higher the price will go, and the more money everyone will get. But that's where collective psychology comes into play: ""What if people start selling before $1000 and I don't make it in time?"" ""What if I sell my bags for a nice profit right now?""

This is known as the prisoner's dilemma , where one person betrays another to make a small profit instead of working with the other person to make a bigger profit for both, only because he's afraid the other person might betray him first.

In this case, if we all hold, we make as much as we want to make. Again, theoretically infinite. If we start betraying each other, we only hurt ourselves, and make less.

The picture is clear, buy and hold until their deadline is up, and sell it to THEM. Not to fellow squeezers.

All of the above applies only to Minecraft. I like the stock. Stock go brrrrr",t3_l6ea1b,36
