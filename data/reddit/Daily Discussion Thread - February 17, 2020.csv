1581964572.0,2020-02-17,wallstreetbets,fhxxvxw,"Here's some DD my dudes. Take it however you want.

SmileDirectClub (SDC) was down 17% on Friday after NBC News released a hit piece on them. I bought calls. I'm a very happy SDC customer and used their product for 6 months. They were extremely transparent with what I should expect from their product and they even created 3D mockups of what my teeth would look like.. I paid the $2k upfront. They turned out exactly as they said it would. 

Here's an excerpt from the response of SDC CEO ((full article here)[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smile-direct-club-turns-up-the-heat-on-nbc-news-investigative-report-235611025.html]): 

NBC News’ story triggered a fierce response by SmileDirectClub Chairman and CEO David Katzman.

“NBC Nightly News ran an incredibly one-sided and distorted report on SmileDirectClub. Given the way in which it portrayed the company, I want to address this story directly. We cannot stand for one-sided, biased journalism that stems from a coordinated attack by trade organizations to limit our success. We also won’t stand by when efforts are being made to limit consumers’ ability to have a real alternative in getting a safe and affordable smile they deserve,”

I find what NBC did as a blatant attack just a week before earnings. I'm bullish. We'll have to see what the numbers say on the 25th.",t3_f577wz,7
