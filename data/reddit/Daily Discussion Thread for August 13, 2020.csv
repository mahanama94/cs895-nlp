1597318366.0,2020-08-13,wallstreetbets,g1bfyvs,"#The Bagholder and The Frog

Once upon a time there was a bagholder and a frog. The bagholder needed to cross the river so he asked the frog for a ride on his back. 

The frog agreed to the bagholder’s request but said “only if you promise to sell those -80% calls as those bags are too heavy for me to carry across the river”.

The bagholder replied “Why would I carry these worthless options with me? We would both drown.”

The frog agreed and told the bagholder to meet him at the river the next day.

The next day came and the bagholder and frog began their journey across the river. 

Halfway through, the bagholder opened his Robinhood and saw that his PRPL and SLV calls had fallen to -99%, dooming them both.

“Why would you not sell? Now we will both drown!”, cried the frog.

The bagholder replied “it is in my nature”.

Republican Senate conservatives don't want a stimulus vote fresh in their voter's minds as fiscal spending is their fucking platform.

Democrats want to do whats right for people, but also understand that this situation likely angers independent voters into potentially voting blue (or not at all?) So why budge too much?

These parties are 2 Trillion away right now. Democrats offered to meet in the middle, but the Republicans are firm on 1T and no mail in ballot protections. If the mail in ballot continues to hold shit up, no deal will get made.

The executive orders won't impact anyone for almost a month, and by then some States & Local governments will be in dire financial situations. That money runs dry fast.
