DD: Florida Tourism Roundtable with Orlando tourist Mike Pence at 3PM ET. White House only schedules events during market hours when they think they can pump. DeSantis and Trump are buddies and DeSantis has been backing Trump more than any governor (debateably Greg Abbott). As thanks for supporting Trump, Pence is in Florida being photographed at local diners to show that the state is safe and tourism is endorsed by the White House. 

Florida allowed theme parks to submit proposals for reopening last Friday. Expect this roundtable to be a pump up of reopening announcements endorsed by Trump with Pence as the model tourist. I expect Disney to be at the roundtable in some capacity. In fact, as I write this multiple sources are saying NBA will happen at DIS.

Don‚Äôt get stuck in this mindset. I missed out on a lot of the April gains because I was there too, focused on how bad covid was. 

Investors will allocate cash wherever they can get the highest yield. Right now interest rates are zero and staying there, and real estate will likely tank with commercial customers vacating. 

Even if the yield is lower than it was, stocks still have about a 5% yield on earnings. Forget if SPY will go up or down, investors are deciding if they want to buy SPY‚Äôs future returns. Right now, that‚Äôs about $15/share annual earnings at a cost of $300. So where else are you going to get that? Until there‚Äôs a viable alternative, stonks will keep going up. 

Also realize, the initial crash was not because investors thought that was what stocks were worth. There was an actual liquidity crisis, which forced sales to make cash available. With fed intervention, that‚Äôs been resolved. The market never believed SPY 220, there were just a lot of institutions forced to sell all at once.

If we are headed to the second Great Depression and the large businesses will have sustained loss of profitability, yes, SPY will rightly go down. But right now most people expect this to be a one wave affair where this is a blip on the radar when taking a a ten year view.",t1_fr8937x,86
