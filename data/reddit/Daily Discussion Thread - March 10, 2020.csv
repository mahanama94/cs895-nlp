 Identified: We have identified that today will be another volatile opening, so we are letting you all know that we will be stepping out of the office before the markets open.  We sent a message to our Bangledesh IT Team's aol email address, and he responded that once the goats have been fed he will update the Status Page.  We commend Azad for correcting the DST problem yesterday once we explained to him what it is.  According to our research we have determined that the calendar will not throw any new ""surprises"" (like DST or Leap Year) at us any time soon.      

Investigating:  As suspected, we isolated the problem.  Our office only has 1 outlet, and unfortunately we tripped the master surge protector.  Just envision Clark Griswald's Christmas house decorations scene and you'll get the idea.  After a few emergency meetings and a very long lunch, the Committee agreed to send Billy's wife to the Dollar Tree to buy a second surge protector.

I lost $30k today and feel nothing. It's all monopoly money anways since they're all long puts expiring at the end of the month. No realized losses = why should I give a shit. It's like the world is trying to play chicken with me as if I had anything to lose. If the economy, run by the dumbest fuck to ever hold tiller, runs aground the beer virus iceburg and shits itself, I'll be rich. If it somehow miraculously recovers despite *already being due for a recession* while in the midst of a global pandemic being vaguely warded off by the prayer candles of the least-qualified person in history to deal with this situation, I'll have a job by the end of the summer.

*Edit*: Guys, I really appreciate it, behind the guise of our stupid juvenile humor here is actually a really amazing and caring community. This post is mostly in fun, me and my family are totally fine. My wife and I have had long talks about our acceptable risk levels and what we think is happening and we're both fine. I spent 1/4 of our liquid assets buying $65k worth of long puts in late February. They're all printing and we're happy with where we're at. We were up $80k yesterday, but because we both think this isn't the bottom, we cashed out only 1/4 of them and are otherwise riding this thing down. The ""$30k lost"" refers to the fact that we're ""only"" up $50k today, which is still the best trading week I'll have in my life. We're doing really well and, even if we weren't, we'd be okay. This was a calculated risk and we're by no means endangering our or our future children's future.

For real, guys, much appreciated, but don't worry. Just stay on your puts and keep up the autism.",t3_fgc3hy,24

1583845114.0,2020-03-10,wallstreetbets,fk3sjgx,"SEC is coming after leveraged and inverse funds

Letter from Direxion funds text following:


Dear Shareholder:
The Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) has proposed regulations that may limit your ability to trade leveraged and inverse funds (‚ÄúL&I Funds‚Äù). The proposed regulations are contained in SEC Release No. 34-87607 (‚ÄúRelease‚Äù), which can be found here.
The proposed regulations, if adopted by the SEC, will require you to provide extensive financial and personal information to your brokerage firm or financial advisor who, after review and evaluation of your financial and personal information, will decide for you whether you are sufficiently ‚Äúcapable of evaluating the risks‚Äù of using L&I Funds. It is possible that you will not be permitted to continue to use L&I Funds if your brokerage firm or financial advisor deems you ‚Äúincapable‚Äù of adequate risk assessment‚Äîeven if you affirmatively represent that you understand and accept the risks of L&I Funds. The proposed Rules also may cause brokerage firms to cease offering L&I Funds given the unprecedented and burdensome due diligence requirement.
The SEC has proposed the new regulations because it believes that you may be incapable of understanding the characteristics and risks of L&I Funds and making your own informed trading decisions. The SEC has not provided any data or evidence in support of this belief and, as you know, Direxion provides comprehensive disclosure of the risks and characteristics of the L&I Funds in our Prospectuses and other materials, which the SEC has not indicated is inadequate in any away. (Appendix A below summarizes a few of the many risks from the Direxion Prospectus.) The belief that investors cannot be trusted to understand clearly disclosed risks is an unprecedented, alarming and notable departure from the bedrock principles of the capital markets and of how the SEC regulates the offering of other securities.
The SEC is seeking public comment on the proposed Rule. Direxion encourages you to provide comments. Please be thoughtful, comprehensive and detailed in your comments to ensure that the SEC understands your perspective as a user of L&I Funds. Please feel free to provide general comments on the appropriateness of such unprecedented regulation and consider addressing any or all of the following topics:
‚Ä¢ A statement that you understand the characteristics and risks of L&I Funds.
‚Ä¢ A description of some of the risks of L&I Funds, including the risk associated with holding these daily beta products for longer periods of time. (Feel free to use your own language or language from the Prospectus or Appendix A.)
  
 ‚Ä¢ The SEC believes that many users of L&I Funds do not monitor their investments. Tell the SEC that you do monitor your L&I Fund positions. Helpful information may include some description of the frequency with which you log-in to your brokerage account.
‚Ä¢ Your opinion on the notion that your brokerage firm should have the right to decide whether you are sufficiently ‚Äúcapable‚Äù to assess risk, or to disqualify you from trading L&I Funds or any other publicly offered investment.
‚Ä¢ A description of the warnings that your brokerage firm already provides in connection with your investments in L&I Funds. In connection with this, given the disclosure of the Prospectus and the attention in the media and the warnings provided by your brokerage firms, do you think it is likely that you would fail to understand the risks of L&I Funds?
‚Ä¢ Your opinion of whether your prior use of L&I Funds should automatically qualify you to continue trading L&I Funds under the proposed regulations.
You may submit your comments here. You can also call us with any questions at 877-437- 9363.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter, and your continued trust in Direxion.
Sincerely,
Robert D. Nestor President",t3_fgc3hy,15

**Identified**: We have identified the coffee shop we are going to at 9:25am.  Mandatory office meeting in order to discuss the Labor Day party later this year.  Our unofficial motto at RH is ""Always Be Prepared"".  

We just received an email from Azad, our IT guy in Bangladesh.  He still uses an aol account, so his email was pushed to our gmail spam account.  We have asked for help from anybody on Fivrr to help us change our settings.  He informed us that the goats have been fed, and he is about to hop on his bike to recharge the car battery that powers his laptop.  Azad assures us that once the market opens he will be able to update the Status Page showing all outages.   


Once again, we commend Azad for correcting the DST problem yesterday once we explained to him what it is.  

According to our research we have determined that DST or Leap Year is not scheduled this week.  

**Investigating**:  We have updated our OS to Windows Vista, which we feel confident will correct all of our problems.  Additionally, due to the unforeseen tripping of the surge protector in our office yesterday, we are banning the use of the waffle iron during the opening of the market.   
 We are 50% confident that with these extreme measures we will be operational by 2pm (est).

Russia is unwise to try and compete with KSA. But I have to imagine that the country hurt most by this will be Iran, as China will stop ""secretly"" buying the cheap Iranian oil and buy the now cheap KSA, etc oil.
