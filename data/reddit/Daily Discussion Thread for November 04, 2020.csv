We rallied ignoring a Europe lockdown 2.0 because there were hopes of blue wave or at least a clear winner with Dems have a shot at flipping the Senate.

It's neither blue wave, POTUS is actively threatening to sue and call the elections fraud and Dems definitely lost the Senate with Mitch McConnell back in charge.

Remember, futures don't mean shit on such days. Things aren't looking good anymore. I was bullish in either case of Trump or Bien winning earlier. But now I am too scared to put my money on something that's against the fundamentals I can clearly see.
