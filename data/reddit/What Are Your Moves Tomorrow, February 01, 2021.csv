I've seen the number $1000 posted all over the place, and honest to god I have no idea why. When you see posts saying we control the price GME will reach, they're not saying it in jest, or as an exaggeration, we genuinely do control the price we want to sell our shares for.

When the people who have opened short positions on GME eventually fold, they will not automatically buy all the shares at $1000 unless that is the price the majority chooses to sell it for. Along this same logic path, if 100% of GME shareholders where to set their limit sell order to $10,000, then $10,000 is what the short holders would have to pay per share, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY AVAILABLE OPTION. 

Now this is definitely not financial advice, I'm retarded, but I also know that from what I've seen I can trust everyone here to HOLD, therefore I also know that those who are tempted to sell at $1000 should also trust others to hold. 

It's very hard to comprehend a scenario which has ""never happened before in human history"", but we are getting damn close to seeing it, and in order to make that scenario a reality you need to not be scared that the price will only reach a maximum, whether that be $100, $1000, or $10,000. 

WE CONTROL THE PRICE, ONE DOES NOT NEED TO SET A LIMIT SELL ORDER, TRUST THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELD... WILL HOLD.",t3_l9lvrn,389

Nobody should be selling anytime soon, but this is very important information. 

LIMIT ORDERS NOT MARKET ORDERS. 

This goes for buying GameStop, but more importantly when you sell it. If you don’t do this, the stock could be $10,000 a share and the hedge funds will still win.

Market order sells your stock at the highest bid price. The stock could be $10,000, but the hedge funds could set the bid price to $500. If you do a market order sell, they could potentially buy it up for $500 a share. 

When you’re buying GameStop, the stock might be $500, but the lowest ask price is $1,000. Now you’re spending $1,000 a share for it when it’s currently at $500. Please for the love of everything, ONLY USE LIMIT ORDERS WHEN BUYING/SELLING GAMESTOP.

With that being said, put your limit order to $69,420 for the time being. And hold strong.

EDIT: I’ve seen posts asking why their platform saying the average cost they paid for the GameStop stock is hundreds of dollars higher than what they thought they bought it for. This is why^^",t3_l9lvrn,92
1612131559.0,2021-02-01,wallstreetbets,glizw5c,"GME is causing me marital strife. 

It's a sad story, I know. I have gained nearly 80k on GME, more $$ than I ever thought I would have at one time. I'm not a rich person. 

I thought the time had come to announce it to my wife and celebrate, which we did over a bottle of wine on **Wednesday night** (important detail). 

**Thursday** happened, my wife glued to her work computer. GME is falling, I'm losing all that money, right? I tell her to not worry, it's all part of the plan.

**Friday** we gap back up $100/share. Here is where the marital strife comes in. My lovely bride demands I sell before I fuck up and lose it all (she knows that I am retarded). She's basically like ""you almost lost it all yesterday when it dropped, you're lucky to get out now."" She doesn't get it. I explain to her again. She gets her mother on the phone (I shit you not). I still am refusing to sell. 

At the end of the day I am brow-beaten into selling all but 50 shares. 

The good news? I am up 80k. I love that, obviously.

The bad news? 1) I let you all down. 2) I know this is going to $10k. 3) Being married can be awful. 

Next steps: Tomorrow morning I drop all $80k into GME. My worry is that it's going to be $600 per share at open and I'll resent my wife until the end of time. 

To those who read this whole thing, thank you. Just had to get this off my chest. 

**tl;dr: Actually don't bother reading the thread it is a sad story of marital problems that probably run deeper than GME who the fuck knows.**

As long as we keep profit taking to a minimum and buy the dips when new shorts come in at the top we can keep pushing mini-squeezes until they break or we accumulate enough shares. All we need is 50-60m shares to hold, if we get that it's infinite losses to anyone left holding the short bag.
