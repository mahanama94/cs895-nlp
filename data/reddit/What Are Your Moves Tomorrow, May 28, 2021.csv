1622173741.0,2021-05-28,wallstreetbets,gzpx1m2,"Since we're talking about short interest again, here's a reminder:

If you have a margin account (you get instant settlement, instant deposits, you have to follow PDT rules), and not a cash account (trades must fully settle after several days), then your broker lends out your shares and collects the short interest premium on them.

You agreed to it when you signed up for a margin account. You have a certificate of ownership of the shares, but the shares are in their custody and contribute to their margin pool. Typically brokers let you short from the broker margin pool for free, but if none are available, they can source shares for the rate if you ask.

RH, TDA, Tasty and Webull works like this. Most others do too. If you're buying and holding shares, you aren't starving shorts. I guess you're driving the price up if you take an ask, but if your transaction is merely helping a bona fide hedger dynamically hedge an option, you aren't reducing the share supply.",t3_nmg57b,12
