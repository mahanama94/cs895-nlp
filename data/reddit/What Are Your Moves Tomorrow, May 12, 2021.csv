A lone butterfly flits through the air, carelessly searching for sustenance and sweet nectar. Thinking not of earthly desires, It knows only perpetual frolic and peace.

""Such a strange looking flower"" it thinks. ""But ne'er a scent have I encountered as sweet as this.""

It descends on its prize, like a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter on the proverbial stone table. Never realizing that it was all smoke in mirrors. A simple parlor trick.
