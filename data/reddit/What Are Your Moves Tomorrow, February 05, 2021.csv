ITS LITERALLY THE VERY FIRST RULE OF THE STOCK MARKET 

DONT . INVEST . MORE . THAN . YOU . CAN . AFFORD . TO . LOSE.  

I bought 4 shares for 100$ each . Am currently down almost 50 percent . 

And guess what , I literally couldnt give a single shit . 

Not coz I'm some seasoned gambler  who doesn't care about money , not coz I believe the stock will go back up .

 But For the simple reason that I CAN AFFORD TO LOSE 400$ if I couldn't I wouldn't have invested it .

Pro tip: if the amount of money you're losing is enough to make you sweat then that means  you couldnt afford to invest that much in the first place and you should stay away from stocks forever",t1_gm1rz02,44
