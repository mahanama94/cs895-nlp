Gf and i moved into a condo with our 9lb lap dog. Dog needs to pee all tf time. It takes several minutes to walk the dog to the designated pee area. Was thinking about building a fishing rod-leash type apparatus to lower my dog off our balcony (second floor) to pee and then reel him in when he‚Äôs done. Does anyone have any good rod recommendations?

Edit: Great suggestions everybody. Gonna head up to Bass Pro Shops and ask about the Ugly Stik. Will post dog lowering vid if successful",t3_ioqzpq,15
