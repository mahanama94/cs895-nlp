IRNT is a great opportunity for the people who can't invest on GOOG AMZN or other expensive high growth stock to invest in.    IRNT is really high growth. 

I do think that it's going up faster after getting noticed worldwide.  It has a lot of trust in the cybersecurity community.   


It will follow the pattern of ascent as CRWD and other cybersecurity companies.  CRWD ipo at $34 only two years ago.  But this one is a current favorite because its CEO is a former NSA chief and its published white paper gain traction for its effectiveness so it will surpass CRWD price.

To add to this, I have a few fundamental concerns. 

TMC is only expecting to generate revenue in 2024. I only mention it as OP goes on about the fundamentals, you would expect him to mention this. 

Also based on the proforma spac transaction the price /net asset value was .35 (I.E $1 buys you 35 cents of NAV). Obviously there are premiums of market value over the NAV but in this case, the business model is unproven and no revenue for years to come.

The valuation/price of the company was based on 1.2x 2027 ebitda. It‚Äôs so far in the future and it‚Äôs valuation would only make sense if interest rates stay as low as it is now for 6 years, which clearly it won‚Äôt.

All the company has at the moment is an area to mine from and cash that people are paying around 4x NAV for. It doesn‚Äôt make sense as it‚Äôs not a functioning business atm.
