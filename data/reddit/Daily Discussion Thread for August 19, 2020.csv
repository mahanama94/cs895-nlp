A few minutes later when you are in his office look him straight in the eye and give him a firm handshake. He should offer you a job with a generous salary, full benefits and a fully vested pension. Say no to the first offer and ask for 20% more.

If this doesn‚Äôt work for you it is because of a lack of character as a result of playing video games and listening to hip hop and/or heavy metal music. This character deficiency can only be resolved by cutting firewood or mowing the grass with a push mower.


Honestly the best way now is to just apply for anything and everything. Last time I was unemployed I applied for somewhere between 50-100 different jobs in a month. I ended up getting 5 interviews and 4 job offers. I got extremely lucky and got a job at my 1st choice of all the jobs I applied for but I also applied for 6 different jobs there in order to get 1 interview, some of which I was way under qualified for. In the past I have applied for a job I was totally unqualified for but nailed the interview and was offered a position 1 rank lower (which was not posted).",t1_g2377g6,18
