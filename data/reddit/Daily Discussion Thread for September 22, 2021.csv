U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment

and price stability goals.

With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic

activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely

affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19

cases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting transitory

factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy

measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and

businesses.

The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress

on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on

the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate

of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this

longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above

2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‚Äëterm

inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to

maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are

achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate

at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until

labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee‚Äôs

**Inflation**

* POWELL: HOUSEHOLDS ARE NOT GOING TO FEEL THE SLIGHT OVERSHOOT IN INFLATION IN OUTER YEARS
* \*Powell: Fed Has More Than Achieved What It Wanted for Inflation Goal

**Tapering**

* Expect to finish taper before liftoff

**Rates**

* POWELL: BAR FOR RATE LIFTOFF IS MUCH HIGHER THAN FOR TAPERING
* \*Powell: Doesn't See Much FOMC Disagreement About Rate Rise Path

**When to Shrink the Balance Sheet**

* ""let's get through the taper decision and let's turn to those issues"" ""We do have the experience of what happened last time"" ""it's not time is my thinking""

**US Default Risk and Debt Ceiling**

* US should not default on debts
* POWELL: NO ONE SHOULD ASSUME THE FED CAN FULLY PROTECT THE MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT

* ""I'm focused on doing my job everyday for the American people and I don't have any comment on that""
