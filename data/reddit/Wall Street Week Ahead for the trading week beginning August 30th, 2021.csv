You didn‚Äôt put the $0.03 in parentheses like some others. Is that a typo?  I guess whisper is expecting positive  earnings. Is that right? Thanks.",t3_pd8xfn,8

1630175545.0,2021-09-06,wallstreetbets,hapmxcd,"Overall thoughts on Chargepoint (CHPT)? ER is Wednesday Sept 1st. 

&#x200B;

\-In Q2, CHPT has bought 2 EV Charging companies in Europe extending its footprint and technologies in the region. 

\-Cash on hand in Q1 was over $100m, I expect it to drop to around $75m 

\-Expected revenue to be in the $46m-$51m - Lets hope this is true. Supply delays can hurt this company

&#x200B;

\-What are everyone thought of CHPT?",t3_pd8xfn,3
