https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html

Feel free to use my complaint summary if you agree:

“Robinhood has gone against the fiduciary duty of its market client base, along with his company’s motto of “democratizing finance for all” by participating in market manipulation. Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States’ foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling. An investigation into Robinhood and similar broker/dealers, along with the hedge funds who have recently lost profits due to their negligent short positions in the stocks mentioned above should take place in order to preserve what’s left of the American democracy.”",t3_l6y2hy,2833

It just hit me and it makes sense. Each day this week the shorts have tried a new and different tactic. Today’s tactic is to only allow selling on Robinhood. That is 🌈🖕🏻🐻😢

HOWEVER!

We still hold ALL the actual cards in our diamond hands. We will not waiver. We will not be intimidated. We will buy buy buy cuz WE LIKE THE STOCK and it just went on SALE!!! GME IS ON SALE!

Obviously they’re gonna make it seem like it’s tanking this morning to force the weak knees to fold. That will NOT BE US.

This latest tactic just SCREAMS desperation to me. We may be worried about losing some trendies, but put yourself in the shoes of the guys who do this for their whole career and life! ID BE ON A FREAKIN LEDGE mentally right about now.

These dudes probably haven’t slept in a week. FUCK THEM! Welcome to the real world asshole!

Edit: This is all PSYOPS guys. To Wall Street, this is WAR. I can speak a bit from experience here. I am a Submarine Officer. Tactics is what I think and breathe. This is AMAZING to see outside of my usual goings on under the sea (darling it's better, down where it's wetter).

Here is their playbook.

Monday: Thought WSB was a joke and didn't care much. Tuesday: Caused dips at regular intervals hoping for panic sells to cover shorts. (Testing our resolve and defenses) Wednesday: Fucked with brokerage services and Reddit to cause us to lose communication ability and hamper our ability to attack (buy buy buy). Thursday (you are here): Took away (for now) our ability to buy on RH. BIG FUCKING DEAL! We can trade elsewhere in the truly free market. Friday until Forever: GET FUK'd.

We know they will play dirty and break the law. Their choices are: cover, admit defeat and lose so much money they go bankwupt. OR, break the laws, be shady AF, and HOPE to outmaneuver us and out gun us.

They only forgot one smol detail. WE ARE RETARDED!

SO! As your commanding officer, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE YOU INGRATES! You sell and die when I fucking SAY you sell and die. TODAY IS NOT THAT DAY!

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

They’re faking a sell off. They’re selling to each other. Don’t take the fucking bait and HOLD 💎🙌🏽💎",t3_l6y2hy,80

They are STILL borrowing shares to short. See how the number is decreasing! That means Short Float IS INCREASING (250% now)!

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

They can only even borrow 75,000 more shares to short. THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER! The battle is almost won! Don't sell until at least 2/12!

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math ain’t capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

Make sure you know the Short Squeeze hasn't even begun!

Another Gamma Squeeze still coming on Friday. SHORTS HAVE NOT CLOSED!

NOTE: THE SUPPLY OF SHORT SHARES AVAILABLE IS GOING UP BECAUSE YOU'RE SELLING, YOU SHOULD DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT

For those of you who are new and scared, we raised the floor of this stock by 100% today, which is OBSCENE, just stay the course.

I'm not an advisor but I LOVE this STONK! 💎🙌🏻

( This is copied from a fellow redditor. I did not write this. This is not financial advice. Just do your research and make the best decisions for you.)

EDIT: This is a once in a lifetime event that they will never risk happening ever again.

Melvin has unlimited loss potential on GME. Their shorts don't expire, naked shorting, 140$ short interest, their weekly and monthly expire on friday and all we need to do is hold onto our shares so that they can't have them and INFINITE SQUEEZE JUST FUCKING HOLD.

They got themselves into an infinite loss scenario doing illegal things because they got greedy and now all we have to do to LITERALLY NAME OUR PRICE is hold shares and not sell and they are forced to give us money infinitely, government bailout and all.

HOLDING UNTIL $69420.00 PER SHARE. Fuck you Wall Street. We're taking our fucking money back

EDIT2: I don't know a day. I don't know how long it will go. I do know that there's nothing they can do, nowhere for them to go if we hold. Then we're gonna see the stock multiply suddenly by 5, by 10, by 100 and that's the moment we're going to be making some new money millionaires all over the country. Godspeed everyone.

You claim your platform's name is Robinhood. But you're actually just Robbinhood. I can't even begin to discuss how disgusting this is.

This brokerage was a joke to begin with but we used you because it was easy and had a cult following. I just want to say, here is a big fuck you for making me lose all of my money. We will ALL collectively file a class action suit. We will ALL leave to other platforms. We will ALL short the shit out of your stock when you IPO. We will NOT stop.

1611850566.0,2021-01-28,wallstreetbets,gl3xze6,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.

If you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

Robinhood Financial LLC 85 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 United States

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price.
