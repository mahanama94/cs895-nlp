1575491313.0,2019-12-04,wallstreetbets,f9nver0,"Essentially if you look at outstanding options on SPY you can see that in order for the currently outstanding options to remain delta neutral (most market makers objectives) they will have to flip their positions from long to short or short to long at these levels. Thus fueling the moves that would push them through such levels in the first place.  


If market makers sell 1,000 calls with delta of 0.8, then they buy 80,000 shares to remain delta neutral.  


If market sells and delta falls to say 0.5 then they have to re balance accordingly to remain delta neutral. In this scenario the market maker would be forced to sell 62.5% of its shares that were originally purchased in order to accommodate the change in delta. (0.5/0.8=62.5%)

If market than rallied afterword market maker would have to add shares to positions as delta increased.  


Essentially you can think about it as an asymptotic relationship where the need to purchase / sell shares in order to remain delta neutral increases as you approach these price points, and the need to do so decreases the closer you are to the median of these points.  


Vix will pop as you cross over these points and fall as you get closer to the median of these points. The data is calculated using options with less than 100 DTE.",t1_f9nrtuq,9
