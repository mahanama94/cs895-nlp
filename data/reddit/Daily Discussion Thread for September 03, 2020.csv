1599148099.0,2020-09-03,wallstreetbets,g3uzxtw,"#What we just saw is funds and MM selling shares to increase liquidity in the market to cover the calls they're writing.

Funds that write calls need to delta hedge by purchasing the underlying shares in the event that these calls are exercised--even if the contract buyers have no plans of exercising their calls.

As more and more people pile in on the options market, delta hedging drives the prices up, which causes more people to throw money at calls in a vicious cycle until a liquidity crunch of available shares happens.

Essentially, we could have a repeat of the March crash if *enough* funds start liquidating shares en masse in order to cover these calls--triggering a price collapse of both the underlying and the call contracts.

Funnily enough, one way to avoid this problem is through stock splits, as it artificially increases the number of available shares for new options buyers to pile in on, but stock splits are only a temporary solution.

Eventually the music is gonna stop, and when it stops, we're probably going to see the collapse of major ETFs and passive investing in general.

But until the music stops, each dip means an increase in liquidity that adds just another few more minutes to the music.

Bonds & fixed income are fucked due to zero interest rates. 

Crowd favorite municipal bonds are triple fucked because so many cities face bankruptcy due to not receiving federal funding for covid. 

REITs are mostly fucked due to garbage rental market and collapsing retail. 

Oil & gas & energy is fucked due to oil prices. 

Retail and consumer goods are fucked due to covid. 

Holding cash? JPOW just announced we’re returning to 5% inflation. 

You could buy metals but they’re at ATH too. 

Everything is fucked while the megacaps are reporting record profits & growth. So where are people pulling their money to? What’s the idea? Because the way I see it, the only sensible option is a swift QQQ recovery from today’s crash, but mob mentality says it may extend into tomorrow as well.
