1635125945.0,2021-07-05,wallstreetbets,hhxov5u,TLDR but I checked their chart and it looks like shit. Iâ€™m going to inverse myself and pick up a couple thousand shares this week.,t3_qf3jaf,13

1635186149.0,2021-07-05,wallstreetbets,hi0jqra,"Thanks for the write up. Many links are not working - could you fix? Makes it easier to understand the underlying calculations!

I am long PRPL as well, but it's tough to assess the potential supply chain issues (if any, tbd) on margins. From a risk reward it's probably better to invest after Q3 ER and/or if it has broken the downtrend.",t3_qf3jaf,3
1635263238.0,2021-07-05,wallstreetbets,hi4l0k7,PRPL is the biggest piece of shit stock ever. Everything ripping higher and this is red everyday.,t3_qf3jaf,3

1635130785.0,2021-07-05,wallstreetbets,hhxy5bj,Yes. Contrarian investing is the way. This play is not riskless over a quarter or two but I have a hard time believing in a share price below 18-19.

1635119973.0,2021-07-05,wallstreetbets,hhxd26x,Can't say I did test the mattress myself but from the comments on their website and reviews on line their product offering is quite unique but polarizing. The market is large enough for them to succeed regardless imo.,t1_hhx96iu,3

1635186750.0,2021-07-05,wallstreetbets,hi0l7o1,Yes. I'll fix the links by end of day. Verifying the supply chain issues or inflation risks by other sources like comparable 10Qs or by other medium would definitely add value to this model. Maybe I'll add that over the week.,t1_hi0jqra,2
