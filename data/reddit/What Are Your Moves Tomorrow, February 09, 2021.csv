Typical ""buy hype, sell news"" scenario. I am still in GME in a reduced position after selling some for profits, but I've been here for a while ($18 w/ double down @ $30) so I'm on house money to see it play out regardless. I do think there's a lot more to the GME story than people are giving credit for on WSB rn, but I also understand how the saturation of  the posts is annoying so it all makes sense. GME was originally about the long but it's also responsible for permanently changing the sub and I think people are understandably upset about that.",t1_gmmgdpl,184
