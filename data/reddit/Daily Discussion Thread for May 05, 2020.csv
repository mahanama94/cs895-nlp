1588674783.0,2020-05-05,wallstreetbets,fpjn8m2,"TL;DR - Today I will get baked, sit on cash and ignore the market because I have no idea WTF is going on.

Back in January, I was non-ironically holding a shitload of:

MSFT 185 05/15 calls

AMD 60 05/15 calls

AAPL 320 05/15 calls

I wanted to hold up until Q1 earnings and my target was to sell when I was a few points ITM. I bought them back when J Pow first started the repo action. Back then ""not QE"" was slated to continue through April.

I literally had an entry price and exit price written down and limit orders set. My options were about 6 months out when I bought them. IV was at historic lows. It was an amazing time to go long on options and was a ""can't go tits up"" play.

I sold them when the market first started to drop for about 30% loss.

It's fucking amazing to me that after the biggest drop EVER these could have still been ITM and even profitable....
