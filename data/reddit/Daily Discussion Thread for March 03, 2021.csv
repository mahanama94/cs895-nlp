[RKT Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwtgh5/rkt_megathread_for_march_3rd_2021)

UWMC was a candidate for a megathread on high premarket volume and mentions, but when I dug into the accounts making those mentions, a lot of them were spam or low effort. We'll keep an eye on it though.

---

Megathreads have been scheduled for the rest of the week for GME / RKT.

GME will be pinned at 8:30am until 9:00am when it gets replaced by RKT, which stays pinned until 9:15am, when it gets replaced by the rules.

More details on how and when megathreads are collected will be will included there.",t3_lwr7oo,1

1614807721.0,2021-03-03,wallstreetbets,gpkz68o,"> The Commerce Department on Friday reported that personal income shot up a seasonally adjusted 10% in January from December, buoyed by the latest round of pandemic-relief payments. Spending rose strongly, too, but with a gain of 2.4% from the prior month, not by nearly as much. And with that, the personal saving rate—or saving as a share of after-tax income—shot to 20.5% from 13.4%. That marks its highest level since May. The only time the saving rate was higher before the pandemic was during World War II.


Things suck now and the market is shit, but I suspect that after the summer ( assuming enough people get vaccinated to reach herd immunity and a complete reopening) we will see a mini-economic boom. The COVID stimulus programs were a huge success, and most people are sitting on much more money than before the pandemic.",t3_lwr7oo,6
