Today we have a couple of PMI reports, starting with manufacturing at 0945 and ISM manufacturing out at 1000. The Chicago PMI on Friday posted its strongest reading since 1983 (not a typo). Factory gate prices rose to their highest level since 1980. There appears to be a clear manufacturing boom happening in this country. And also inflation, which the Fed calls transitory.

Speaking of the Fed, we get a speech from Chairman Powell at 1430. Not expecting him to say much if he didn‚Äôt deviate from his commentary last week.

Also a ton of earnings. Lowe‚Äôs just came out with a beat on EPS. Reopening trade companies Wynn Resorts and Avis are out later.
