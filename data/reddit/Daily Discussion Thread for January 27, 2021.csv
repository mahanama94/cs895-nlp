Melvin Capitol is expected to start filing for bankruptcy as ‚Äúearly as next week,‚Äù according to some sources. Friday isn‚Äôt even here yet and we‚Äôve managed to drive up the price 760% in the past week alone.

We even have Daddy Elon on our side now, and if you autists have learned anything, it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt bet against Elon and walk away without consequences. I won‚Äôt be surprised if a selloff happens soon, as shortsellers (for whatever reason) might still be trying to trigger a massive selloff. They know they‚Äôre knee-deep in shit swamp with no way out except to liquidate their positions and ironically buy GME shares themselves, which will drive price even further up. If we stay strong, GME can easily surpass 1000. I‚Äôm betting we hit double at MINIMUM. 

All this being said, some of you will be wishing that you bought now and FOMO will eat away at you as we see this head to fucking Jupiter. If you want a funny number as a reasonable SellPoint, try 69,420. See you guys in the next galaxy soon üöÄüöÄüöÄ",t3_l6261q,586

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

To the moon my dear retards!
