1613598660.0,2021-02-18,wallstreetbets,gntaw8s,"If you have any FOMO on RIOT, just realize that we are living in unprecedented times where we can and more likely will experience these types of bubbles more often than ever before.

There is so much liquidity chasing whatever asset shows short-term ""get rich quick potential"" that we literally can see an EV/weed/c r y pt o type bubble every month or two (source: past 4 months).

The next few years are likely to see a greater influx of money into stocks (by whatever terms you want to use like % of overall market cap) than any other similar period in history (mid-90s or before).  Multiple trillions will enter and while much will seek safe stocks like big tech or whatever, much will go for more speculative boom/bust sectors...

Why? Because there's no comparable sources of return out there.  Everything else looks like crap compared to stock returns right now.

So it's not worth blowing up your account chasing one bubble when the next is just around the corner.  None of these are ""once in a lifetime opportunities"", they aren't even ""once in a year"" opportunities.  There will be many more to chase as long as you still have money in your memefolio.

Always focus on the next one and be willing to turn the page if you watched one run but never pulled the trigger.  If you were watching RIOT at $5 or $10 or $20 or $40, then $80 isn't the time to get into it.",t3_lm4k2z,205

The recent frenzied-movements in so-called meme stocks like **GameStop Corp** (NYSE: [GME](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GME)) are causing the apex market regulator to consider ushering in more transparency in short trades, the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-frenzy-prompts-sec-to-weigh-more-short-sale-transparency-11613593827?mod=hp_lead_pos3) Wednesday.

**What Happened:** The  United States Securities and Exchange Commission, now under Democratic  control, is pondering exercising its authority to make short trading  less opaque, according to the Journal.

On Thursday, House  lawmakers will look into GameStop trading and discuss the shortage of  data on the short sales, as per a memorandum issued in advance of the  hearing.

The memo observed that the SEC had not completed its responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank mandate, as per the Journal.

**Why It Matters:** The  2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms required the SEC to gather  information on how much stock of each public company has been shorted.  The market regulator does not gather or reveal such data on specific  trades, the Journal noted.

In the past, the SEC has refused to  mandate greater disclosure of short selling including data on how much  of a particular stock has been lent out.

A provision of Dodd-Frank  required the SEC to issue rules within two years that would increase  public knowledge about lent or borrowed shares.

Another provision would require the SEC to publish monthly disclosures on how many shares of a public company have been shorted.""",t3_lm4k2z,14
