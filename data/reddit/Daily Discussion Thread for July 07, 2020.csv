It SUCKS ASS dragging your little kids to Walmart to buy groceries.  Grocery pickup was already huge for WMT.  

Now you don't even have to load the kids up in the minivan. You just order and it shows up at your house.  

I get it, most of you are 20 and have no kids.  But many of us are in the suburbs with kids and going to WMT is a pain in the ass. However, WMT has great variety and prices. 

This is why this is a big deal.  People already pay $100 a year for AMZN so they can get cheap garbage delieved to their house that isn't even always very essential. 

AMZN can't compete on the grocery and everyday goods things like this with WMT in most markets.
