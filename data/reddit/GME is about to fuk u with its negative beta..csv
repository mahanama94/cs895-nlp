1631895660.0,2021-05-30,wallstreetbets,hd821s8,"This is great work my dude/gal, but to play devils advocate:

Personally not a giant fan of the idea of trading based on beta, especially on meme stocks / squeezes where the historic math gets really whacky and I don’t trust the number to be truly indicative of covariance with the market. I look at beta to ascertain portfolio-level systematic risk long/short and to arrive at discount rates for stocks with more stable beta histories (CAPM fun) always remembering that beta is subject to critiques as a true measure of systematic risk in an individual equity. (So I will often make adjustments to the beta and/or cost of equity / discount rate based on a factor model including things like size premium and behavioral factors.) 

But perhaps more importantly, GME caused the VIX to spike because of the hedge fund fallout that caused a selloff in other SPY names. The VIX spiking isn’t necessarily a causation event in reverse for a run on GME. 

Again, this is great work but just want to entertain a conversation on some flip-side points.

Also the alligator picture is A+ lmfao",t3_pq0aiy,84

You have to read between the lines on certain aphorisms. 

Just because they rhyme, doesn’t mean they’re in line (with reality).

Sometimes phrases are repeated despite being untrue for the most part, simply because sometimes they are true.

1631909013.0,2021-05-30,wallstreetbets,hd8xlnk,"To me it is more indicative that a rise in GME can cause the fall of other assets when HF’s sell off. Therefore if assets plummet for HF’s then they will likely fail a margin call and be forced to rebuy the shorted shares which are all being tucked away in ComputerShare shares.

The only question is whether or not Hedgies covered in January. If they didn’t, cover in the January plummet, and if they didn’t cover when the stock fell back to $40 I would assume they never covered from March-now. 

Reading into the Total Return Swaps being used to package collateral and sell them off to unknown entities (assumed to be shell companies owned by hedgies) they are able to hide their shorts, however FTD’s being over 1 million the first week of every month shows that there are over 100 million shares unaccounted for which is well above the float.

I’m convinced that this thing will moon, the question is when. A market crash could be a catalyst as hedgies fail margin calls. If nobody sells their CS shares then it really is an infinity squeeze until those real shares are finally sold. Rehypothecated shares being bought back should not balance their shorted shares.",t1_hd80bk5,16

However, since beta is calculated using historical data points, it becomes less meaningful for investors looking to predict a stock's future movements.""

""Beta is also less useful for long-term investments since a stock's volatility can change significantly from year to year, depending upon the company's growth stage and other factors.""

Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp

TLDR: This post is based on a misunderstanding of a basic financial concept. Beta is not a future predictor of performance, and it's heavily distorted by volatility from external events. It's a known phenomenon that in market crashes, correlations increase. If the market crashes, GME is most likely going to crash too.

Understandably, VIX spike ❌= additional buying pressure for GME. The chain reaction looks more like: GME buying pressure builds up -> hedgies need more collateral to survive and to continue playing dirty -> they liquidate chunks of portfolios, and because the players are big moni bois it means the volume is considerable enough to disturb the broader market -> the unready unhealthy market smells something’s fishy -> VIX goes up.
