They'll turn up your driveway, not even know for sure why they're doing it.  They'll arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past.  ""Of course we don't mind if you look around,"" you'll say.  ""It's only $20 per person.""  And they'll hand over the money without even thinking about it.  For it is money they have, and peace they lack.

And they'll walk out to the bleachers...sit in ahirtsleeves, on a perfect afternoon.  They'll find they have reserved seats.  Somewhere, up along one of the baselines, where they sat when they were children, and cheered their heroes.  They'll watch the game, and it'll be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters.  The memories so thick, they'll have to brush them away from their faces.  

""You'll lose everything, Ray.""

People will come, Ray.

""You'll be evicted!""
