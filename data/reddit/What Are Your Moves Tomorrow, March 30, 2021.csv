Continued shortages and supply/logistical problems have caused the costs of many basic materials like aluminium to spike up and often double/triple, meaning that there's possibly some significant price inflation on the horizon. 

Steel price is up 190% from last year

Several materials needed for solar panel production like glass and polysilicon are in short supply too

The price of shipping a container across the world has gone up from +-$2000 to $8000-$12000

And that's not nearly all of it, stuff like wood and ofcourse semiconductors are also suffering significant shortages

I used up all my PDT day trades last Friday, but saw a good opportunity for an SPY put late in the day today. I bought the option, but then realized the expiration date is TODAY!!!

Apparently SPY has more than just weekly options, wow who knew lol. So I decided I'd rather let it expire worthless, if it does expire worthless, it was very exciting to watch in a really weird way.

Turns out, it went ITM! But what ended up happening is that E-TRADE automatically closed my position before I could, I was waiting until the very last minute hoping that it would end OTM and worthless.

So since E-TRADE was the one who made the PDT technically, since they sold it, it appears that I have not been flagged for violating PDT rules.... at least so far. Very interesting, I hope I don't get PDT status, otherwise gonna switch brokerages I think.",t3_mfy3xf,9
