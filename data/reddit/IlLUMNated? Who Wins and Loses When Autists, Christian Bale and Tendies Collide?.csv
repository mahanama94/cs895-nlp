2019-11-24,wallstreetbets,gqpqqpe,"Bougth at $ 9,70 and sold my stake a few weeks ago. If interest rates are being increased (which is likely this year), LUMN will suffer since they have a massive debt burden. I wouldn't touch it now because of that and the recent spike in price may limit any further upside. You should also mention that they have declining revenue and try everything to whitewash their bottom line. 

In short, there are better plays out there. If LUMN's price falls back to 10 Dollars a share or even below, grab as much as you can.",t3_m39ee9,0

2019-11-24,wallstreetbets,gqqn6gz,"I cut almost all of my calls on that short squeeze kept the leaps. No one goes broke taking profits. Ill add on dip days and sell on pops when it comes to the share front. Working to get my cost basis down enough to where shares are free. Plus, that yummy div.",t1_gqqgkcg,3
2019-11-24,wallstreetbets,gqpus2a,"They refinanced a lot of debt at extremely low rates for long period of time. If rates increase in the future it will likely due to inflation, it will be great for them because they will be paying debt with inflated $$.

Also, their fibers will worth more in an inflationary situation.  So the company is worth more on a sum of all part valuation.

If you break it apart, the value of fibers will worth a lot more than current price.",t1_gqpqqpe,7
2019-11-24,wallstreetbets,gqq5kox,"Sounds like someone's mad at missing out on selling at $14.50.

I did mention it on my last DD. Revenue might be down but so is debt and operating costs. Further, their profit margin went up.

On top of all of this, they've made a wild amount of acquisitions in the last 6 months which looks to me they are utilizing to cut down on debt. They did some convertible debt offerings with Qwest, for example.  

As I advocate in my post, very long dated calls or spreads are the move with LUMN, not FD's. For the cost of a couple GME shares, leap spreads will get you $25k if they get ITM, and they've got a year for that. 

You don't need to buy in, but the div, the upside and the still rapidly evolving company gives me hope. They were a telecom provider a few short years ago. The recovery from 2019 to 2020 is fucking impressive IMO considering the pandemic.  

Don't worry bro, me and everyone else will wave at you from tendie town. ðŸ˜˜",t1_gqpqqpe,2
