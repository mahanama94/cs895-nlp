Main requirement to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Only profitable companies are allowed in SPY, it automatically adjusts to whatever makes money in todays economy.

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 10-20 unprofitable loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY adjusts to the economy constantly, it always follows profits.
