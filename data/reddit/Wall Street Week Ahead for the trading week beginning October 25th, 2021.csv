1634947154.0,2020-06-28,wallstreetbets,hhoopdt,Appreciate you. I actually include your posts in my premarket research in the AM,t3_qdt6qu,7
1634947584.0,2020-06-28,wallstreetbets,hhopja8,"Nice write up OP.  Nothing earth shattering for $F on the 27th, but been consolidating around $16.25 (Good for my ITM Calls) this week, so maybe a nice run up $17. Personal Price Target for $20 EOY, which I believe may come with IPO of Rivian instantly if happens by EOY.",t3_qdt6qu,3
