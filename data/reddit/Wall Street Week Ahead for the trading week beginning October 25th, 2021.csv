Hey /u/bigbear0083, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.",t3_qdt6qu,1
1634947154.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhoopdt,Appreciate you. I actually include your posts in my premarket research in the AM,t3_qdt6qu,15
1634947584.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhopja8,"Nice write up OP.  Nothing earth shattering for $F on the 27th, but been consolidating around $16.25 (Good for my ITM Calls) this week, so maybe a nice run up $17. Personal Price Target for $20 EOY, which I believe may come with IPO of Rivian instantly if happens by EOY.",t3_qdt6qu,7
1634950599.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhovfo9,I love this author,t3_qdt6qu,7
1634955216.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhp4eai,Thank you for putting this together - saved me much time,t3_qdt6qu,3
1634957506.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhp8qvp,Great job! Whats everyone's thoughts about snap? I feel like the 27% drop is too much and that they still have a great user base. That being said we could also see it drop next week when FB gives their earnings.,t3_qdt6qu,3
1634987300.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhqbbo1,"DWAC. Dont underestimate boomers and trump supporters. This isnt only going to grow in the US its global. Will compete with Facebook, Twitter, Fox and CNN. Boomers have all the money, where is it going to go?",t3_qdt6qu,1
1634962535.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhph8sb,"When I saw it, I said ""*oh snap!*"".",t1_hhp8qvp,5
1634975621.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhpy6i7,"Yeah my little sister and her friends will meet up and not talk to each other, they will just be on their phones looking at snap in silence, it's weird lol. Snap is the ""in thing,"" especially over lockdown when everyone had nothing else to do. But FB aren't doing great atm, so it will probably drop even more with FB's earnings next week. I don't see it going back up to it's YH's, but it's still worth more than what it is now, so could be a profitable long.",t1_hhp8qvp,3
1634982149.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhq5dei,"I may not be the target demographic (I’m 33), but I feel like snap has basically died over the past year.  I haven’t used it at all, and today out of curiosity I got on and saw that pretty much none of my friends do as well. 

A lot of my friends work in entertainment (musicians/ djs/artists) which by its very nature means they need to have a bigger presence on social media.  Almost none of them are posting snaps, where as a year or two ago they were consistently. 

Honestly, I think when Instagram started “stories” that was the killer for Snapchat.  It’s pretty much the same thing, only it’s on a social media platform that people actually use (at least in my peer group).",t1_hhp8qvp,2
1635031774.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhsqpe9,It's going to be an absolute shit interface and the whole identity of Republicans now is owning the libs. Without any libs to own most won't stay long.,t1_hhqbbo1,3
1634992502.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhqih83,Thats what ive noticed as well. Millennials use insta but gen Z will use snap. Also I think parents are on insta which will make it not fun for their kids along with everything that has come out against FB /insta.,t1_hhpy6i7,2
1634989804.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhqejla,"When Instagram made stories a thing, you could just hear the millions of uninstalls",t1_hhq5dei,2
1634996795.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhqq5w1,"Just FYI, snap is the easily the most used social media for texting purposes in the UK for 16-21 year olds

Idk what its like in the US but I imagine its similar",t1_hhq5dei,2
1635032047.0,2020-11-29,wallstreetbets,hhsrafo,"Reddit wasnt great at first either. If this is half as good, ill take it. Gotta start somewhere. People will put $ and resources into this once the value is realized.",t1_hhsqpe9,1
