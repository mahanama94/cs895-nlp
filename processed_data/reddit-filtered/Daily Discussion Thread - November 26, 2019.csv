 Holy fcking shit, options is not for me boys, bought my first options  yesterday for 1,3 k and I wastly unterestimated the psychological  pressure.

What are wbs strats for handling this massive pressure buying in the week expiring otm options.

I  woke multiple times up at night and stared at wbs and yahoo discussion  threat like i went completely insane. Then i literally stared atleast 30  min at pre Hours trading.

These are my buys from yesterday in case you want to know:  [https://imgur.com/a/PKUJFHa](https://imgur.com/a/PKUJFHa)  (posted those in the tesla discussion thread yesterday)

However  afterwards i bought those i doubled my position because i realised how far out of the money that was so i bought another 2k worth of 325 Tesla  puts([https://imgur.com/a/AIwOK1u](https://imgur.com/a/AIwOK1u)).  Which just doubled. So because of this massive psychological pressure i  sold them. Which means i am now freerolling the rest and feel so much  stress relief.

I guess i am never  going to buy options again. Wtf. I literally spent 24 hours only  thinking about my options. Holy fcking shit guys, how do you handle the pressure?",t3_e1who6,14

>(Bloomberg) -- The recent re-flattening of the yield curve has turned the **spread between five-year and three-month Treasury rates negative again**, albeit just barely at less than one basis point (and perhaps only temporarily?) As a reminder, **this is the spread that Duke Professor Cam Harvey** **used** **in his seminal research on the yield curve as a recession signal in the 1980s.** It inverted from the middle of March until almost the end of October, then spent most of November in positive territory.There have been enough smart ""this time is different"" arguments made about yields this year to entertain the idea that maybe this time really is different.
