As some of you know, I got distracted and made the dumb mistake of purchasing Dunkn' Donuts instead of DraftKings (DNKN vs DKNG) this morning. So I started looking into what was going on with Dunkn' Donuts ever since the proposed takeover/buyout at $106 by Inspire Brands. Turns out lawsuits have been filed questioning whether the consideration and the process that led to the deal are adequate, or whether the consideration undervalues the Company. 

In short, there is a chance this deal may fall through. And guess what? $110 calls even 1 or 2 years out are dirt cheap...like a nickel or a dime. 

From the looks of it, this deal closing out is already delayed and even a small issue could send this to the toilet meaning DNKN can continue its already meteoric rise well above its current $106 plateau in the coming months.

I dunno, but those cheap call options seem like a nice bet right now. Let me know if you think I'm crazy.
