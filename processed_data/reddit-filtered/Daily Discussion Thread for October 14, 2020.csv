I've been hugely bullish on NIO due to the fact that it was undervalued hugely relative to TSLA.  Now it's basically caught up to TSLA on a relative basis and is much more likely to move in-line with TSLA.  Analysts are now openly bullish as opposed to how much more conservative their PTs were a few months ago.
