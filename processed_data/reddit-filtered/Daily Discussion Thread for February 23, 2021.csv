&#x200B;

* Well diversified portfolios tend to perform better. 
* Do not panic. As long as you do not immediately need the money, do not sell. Prices usually bounce back within a few months. 
* Commodities such as gold and silver are typically safe investments. 
* Physical resources such as firearms and ammunition are a necessity. 
* Protect your investments by barricading your home. Closet doors can be used to create makeshift shutters. Place barbed wire on the interior of windows to create entry hazards that are not easily cleared. 
* Scout your neighbors. Know what their resources are. You may need to kill them before this is over.",t3_lqfr4s,75

&#x200B;

1. **Clowns are right and Corona will be over in a few weeks:**  
Scenario is self-explanatory... Disiney benefits massively from reopening of theme parks and cruise ships.
2. **Corona will last at least until 2022 or even longer**:   
Disney's streaming business is booming and they have even managed to make a profit despite Corona (against all expectations). 
3. **Yield shitshow goes into the next round:**  
Disney took on more debt during Corona, so rising interest rates could lead to trouble. However, the condition for rising interest rates is the end of Corona and thus the occurrence of scenario 1. That means Disney will have absolutely no problems to pay debts. 
4. **Yield shitshow has an imminent end:**  
For the current situation, see point 3: In this scenario, Disney can take on more debt and thus push its streaming service further and increase revenues again.

1. Denial – The first reaction is denial. In this stage, individuals believe the losses are somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality.
2. Anger – When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: ""Why me? It's not fair!""; ""How can this happen to me?""; ""Who is to blame?""; ""Why would this happen?"".
3. Bargaining – The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for gains are made in exchange for handjobs. 
4. Depression – ""I'm so sad, why bother selling?""; ""I'm going to be broke anyway, so what's the point?""; ""I miss my money; why go on?""  
During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their losses.
5. Acceptance – ""It's going to be okay.""; ""I can't fight it; I may as well prepare for it.""  
In this last stage, individuals embrace the inevitable future of giving handjobs behind Wendy's",t3_lqfr4s,16
