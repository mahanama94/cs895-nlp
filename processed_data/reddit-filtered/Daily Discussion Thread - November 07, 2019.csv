Revenge trading could potentially destroy your life much more than you think it’s destroyed now. Take shit day by day and try to focus on the small wins in your life.

Now with re-elections looming he has to wrap this up and can no longer afford to draw it out much further.

If he drags it out and the economy tanks, he loses.
