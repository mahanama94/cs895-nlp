I've been running a test.  In one account, I trade triple leveraged ETF's, just straight shares-SPXU and UPRO.  In another, I buy options on SPY.  Both accounts have the same directional bias at any given point in time-SPXU shares/SPY puts, UPRO shares/SPY calls.    


I use limit buys and trailing stops to get out of the ETFs.  I use limit orders on options, no stops.  The option expirations are usually within a week, and the trades in/out within 0-1 days.  


Gain/Loss ratio trading 3x ETF's - 28 closing trades in the last 30 days, 89% of them profitable.  Net gain - 18k.  Starting account size - 57k, end value, \~75k
