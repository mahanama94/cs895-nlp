1587472764.0,2020-04-21,wallstreetbets,fo2s7sb,"This is a fair warning to all of the bulls out there:

You have just seen what happens to a market that refuses to accept factual reality. Oil has had a significant decline in demand, and the supply continued at essentially the same level as prior to the shutdown. Suddenly, everyone is ""surprised"" that there is a massive crash when the rubber hits the road - when it's time to actually take delivery of the physical oil, no one wants it.

The stock market is about to experience the same thing. I don't know if it'll be in a week or if it'll be in a few months, but it is coming. The price of a stock is predicated that the business issuing it is profitable. That there are profit margins in the day-to-day activities, that more money comes in then goes out. Right now, that is a very small number of businesses. The vast majority of our economy is taking out loans in order to stay afloat, have laid off large percentages of their employees, and has no significant revenue at this point. The customer base is who's being laid off, and $1,200 stimulus checks isn't going to go far.

You bulls who keep denying the reality that this is a black swan event of unparalleled history, and keep buying ""the dip"" - you can keep this bubble inflated for a little while, but when it finally pops, you're going to be in the slaughterhouse. 

It happened during the 2008 crisis within the financial sector, brought on by denial of reality in the housing market. This is going to be bigger than that, because it's not just housing that's over inflated in value - we've shut down essentially the entire economy. If you're trying to make the case that the economy should be near where it was before we shut down, harsh reality is coming for you.",t3_g5cllb,67
