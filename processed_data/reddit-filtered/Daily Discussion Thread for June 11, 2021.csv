The process:

1) Memestock gets P&D'ed and spammed on WSB

2) Watch as stock goes up +40%.

3) Buy in at ATH expecting +100% tomorrow.

4) Watch as stock drops 30% from ATH the next day.

5) Go on Google and search for articles that confirm the company is a) undervalued b) a hidden gem c) a great recovery play d) a long term play

6) Go back on WSB and bring the good news to all like-minded individuals

7) Quietly sell off your position at -45%.

8) Repeat Step 1.",t3_nxcaz5,61

2. Large gamma squeeze play happening, if it closes about $13 on 6/18 an enormous amount of shares are bought 
3. Great company overall, IE not a bag, constantly focusing on growth and gaining all kinds of new contracts.
4. Amazon is contracted with them at ~$13. Amazon is not in the business of losing money.
5. Two down days after a monster rally is nothing. If that is enough to chase you out, i genuinely don‚Äôt understand how you have any money left.
