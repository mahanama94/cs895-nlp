Good afternoon {COMPANY} shareholders, we have very exciting news to share with you regarding our cash flow from this last quarter.  As many of you know, 90% of our work force has been working from home, jiggling the mouse every 15 minutes to appear active in Microsoft Teams, while beating their dicks raw to porn and day drinking in their underwear for the past 45 days.

The remaining 10% of our work force has been designated as essential employees, and have been in the office compiling reports about which of these dick beaters will be the first that we let go upon the grand re-opening of the US economy.  Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\_PERCENTAGE}.

Thanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.

While we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.",t3_fwim5b,15
