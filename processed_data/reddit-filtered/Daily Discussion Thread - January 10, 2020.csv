For those interested, see the following report from [Barrons.com](https://Barrons.com) (sorry no link, this showed up in my ToS ""terminal"")

Edit: due to the weird 'typo' below (as u/BilldaCat10 pointed out) I am providing a link to a different story on MarketWatch: 

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-creates-145000-new-jobs-in-december-2020-01-10?mod=newsviewer\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-creates-145000-new-jobs-in-december-2020-01-10?mod=newsviewer_click)

Please forgive any formatting issues.

>*The U.S. added 145,000 new jobs in December, representing a slowing but        decent labor market.*  
>  
>*Stocks hung onto early, modest gains following the report. Futures on S&P        500 were up 4.25 points while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures        gained 14 points.*  
>  
>*The increase of 145,000 nonfarm payrolls fell short of the 160,000 that        economists polled by Bloomberg expected. The result is        significantly lower than the Nov. 2019 increase, which        was revised slightly lower to 256,000, and it's below the average        monthly gain of 174,000 during 2019.*  
>  
>*The unemployment rate held at a half-century low of 3.5%, matching        economists' projections.*  
>  
>*As hiring cooled, so did increases in workers' pay. Average hourly        earnings rose 0.4% in December from November, slower than the 0.3% gain        (which was revised from 0.2%) a month earlier. The increase was below        economists' expectations for 0.3% wage growth. On a year-over-year        basis, workers' hourly pay rose just 2.9%, the lowest since Sept.        2018 and below an expected 3.1% rate of increase.*",t3_emphz2,7
