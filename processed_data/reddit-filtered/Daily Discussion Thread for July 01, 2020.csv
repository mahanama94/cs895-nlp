#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 


#____________________


Asian markets have bounced of their major support and have are testing their intermediate resistance


**India** up 1.25% 

**Hangseng** up 0.5% (closed today)

**Nikkei** down 0.75%


#_____________________



Europe indices are facing selling pressure and are testing their support (they started to go down biggly in a small interval of time)

**Dax** down 1.37% 


**CAC40** down 1.30%


**FTSE** down 1.30%


#_____________________


**Dow** (25,451.0)  -238.0. (-0.93%)

#____________________

Global markets are in general trading in the range determination in the previous week, but an exciting observation is that some global market have breached their intermediate resistance but Europe indices are nearing their support again

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

We were going long at the very moment spy Was at 300 and we got lucky that 295 stop loss dint get hit, something to worry about today is that we are trading in a range and are at the upper end of it, we are still bullish but recommend to shift stop losses to 305 from 300


Major support is still 295 and 300 and resistance is at 314 and 320,


#Personal bias is that we will trade today between 307 - 314 with an expectation that 307 becomes a short term support


Highly recommend to the people talking longs today to have you stops at 305, as breaking 305 would invite 300 again

#____________________


**Longterm** : for long term investing we keep an eye on Nasdaq charts and were skeptical when Nasdaq was below its 10k psychological support, but sirprisingly that support is reclaimed, the sentiment on long charts is flat to bullish thus create an accumulation zone in sip mode for long term stock holding


#______________________

Even after the support of 300 being respected, we are relatively flat for past month, highly recommend to book profits on upper end of ranges, or at least pushing your Stop losses if riding all the way





#____________________


Random tip for the day : ""stock market is not a mirror of current scenario but rather a forecaster of future, when you take position, you are trying to predict the future, so don't tell it what to do rather see what it's doing ""

It seems to me like a big motivation for propping up equities was that boomers need to be able to retain their wealth because they all are heavily exposed to equities and even a 3-5 year bear market would wipe out retirements and bankrupt the US. Social security is not able to function as a sole source of income considering people are living longer.

But at these prices, who the hell are they selling to when they retire and/or need cash to live?

Eventually there needs to be a greater fool right? 

I don't see how young people straddled with student loans and low wages are going to be able to hold this thing up when the time comes.
