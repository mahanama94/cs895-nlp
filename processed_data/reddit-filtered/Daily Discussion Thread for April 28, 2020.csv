Since the beginning of  March,  the  12-month  forward  consensus  forecast  for  S&P  500 earnings  has  plunged  19%  from  around  $180  per  share  to  $143. Slap  a  15x  multiple  on  that  and  you  get  2,145  as  fair-value  in  the index. You know what that means, correct? It means that the forward P/Emultiple  (on  year-ahead  earnings  forecasts)  has  expanded  from 16.3x at the end of March to 20.1x currently. So themultiple peaked at 18.3x at the end of 2019, was 16.6x at the end of February, and at the height of the angst,closed at 16.3x at the end of March. Now it  is  at 20.1x!  The cycle  peak  in  the  2007  credit  bubblewas  15.2x. We  have  not  seen  such  a  lofty  multiple  in  eighteen  years!!  Go  back into the history books, and you will see that barely more than 10% of the time in the past has the multiple been as high as it is today, and we have never, not once, been this high in the context of a recession, even if you believe we are at or near the end of a recessionary bear market in stocks. [...] Keep that in mind ‚Äî20x is basically a ‚Äúpeak cycle‚Äùmultiple saved for periods  like  1999  and  2000  when  investors  are  pricing  in  endless growth premised on a new  productivity-enhancing innovation called the Internet. I suppose today‚Äôs innovation is a printing press to deal with  a  giant man-made  economic  hole.  You  see,  the  Internet  was something new and did elicit, for a while, a 20x-plus P/Emultiple. As it turned out, even that invention (which changed the world)couldn‚Äôt overwhelm the business cycle and at no time in history have multiples this rich been sustained for very long. - Dave Rosenberg (from Early morning with Dave)",t3_g9kncr,9
