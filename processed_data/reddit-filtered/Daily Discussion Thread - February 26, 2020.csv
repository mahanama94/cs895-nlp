So as many of us thought, there was a big pump at open (+1%) which actually brought us up to a previous extension (3173) that we blew past yesterday. Tried to break through twice before rejecting hard through 3147 which then acted as resistance. It then tried to break and hold above 3147 before dropping HARD right as the candle touched the 200ma (5 minute chart). It fell right through the 3125 level that we bounced around eod yesterday before some good news from NY caused a momentary green dildo. We're currently testing 3125 again to see if we can break and hold above. We've already tested and failed on 2 consecutive 5 min candles and if we see 1 or 2 more failures, I'd think we're headed down to 3104 which is the next extension down.

1582747507.0,2020-02-26,wallstreetbets,fiusmbi,"A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday as several other countries also confirmed new cases and deaths, and President Trump called for a 6 p.m. news conference with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others to discuss the spread of the virus. He accused the media of stoking panic about financial markets.

The Dow Jones industrial average endured its worst two-day slump in four years Tuesday. On Wednesday, it was up 300 points shortly after open.

On European and Asian financial markets, economic alarms continued to flash, however, with cases spreading and little sign that the epidemic was relenting after the CDC warned of the ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù spread in the United States of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which has been designated as SARS-CoV-2.

France reported the first death of a French citizen from the epidemic as cases grew rapidly across Europe, with Spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in Germany, Greece, France, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland. A new case in Brazil marks the first known case in Latin America. Although China announced a decline in new confirmed cases on Wednesday, the number of infected people soared in South Korea to more than 1,200, with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200,000 people.

Here are the latest developments:

‚óè A new case of coronavirus was confirmed in the United States on Wednesday, bringing the country‚Äôs total to 15.

‚óè France reported the first coronavirus death of a French citizen amid a dramatic uptick in cases within Europe. Most new cases are connected to an outbreak in northern Italy, still the largest on the continent.

‚óè Brazil confirmed its first case, which also marks the first known case in Latin America.

‚óè Europe‚Äôs benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.6 percent in midday trading Wednesday, while Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7 percent and Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 closed down nearly 0.8 percent, as the coronavirus‚Äôs rapid spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea seemed to reinforce investor fears that the worst is yet to come.

‚óè Statistics released by the Chinese government showed a decline in the number of new cases in mainland China; an additional 406 cases were reported Wednesday morning, along with 52 deaths. All but five of the new cases and all of the new deaths were in Hubei province.

‚óè South Korea reported 284 additional cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, raising the national tally to 1,261. That number is expected to rise in coming days as the country begins the mass testing of more than 200,000 members of a messianic religious movement at the center of an outbreak in the city of Daegu.
