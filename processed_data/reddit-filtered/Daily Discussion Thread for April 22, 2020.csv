>  
>For Wall Street’s biggest banks, negative oil has meant a frantic scramble over the past 24 hours to recalculate the value and riskiness of their trading books to account for a world in which oil can go negative. It has also literally broken the models that many traders rely on to calculate risk.  
>  
>The implications are enormous. Allowing for the possibility of negative prices has made some positions much riskier, exposing some banks and traders to potentially significant losses and triggering a rush to recalibrate that has exacerbated the wild swings in the markets.  
>  
>In particular focus are put options, which banks typically sell to oil producers wanting to hedge against a sharp drop in prices. Conventional ways to calculate the price of options, like the famed Black-Scholes model, operate on the assumption that oil prices can’t go below zero. With the decline in oil prices now potentially limitless, there is no longer a cap on the potential losses. - BLOOMBERG

Fucking bullshit.

JPMorgan Chase has $2.9 trillion exposure in off-balance sheet items versus $2.3 trillion on its balance sheet with $246 billion in equity capital. That information comes directly from JPMorgan Chase’s [Uniform Bank Performance Report](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=852218&peerGroupType=&supplemental=) for December 31, 2019 at the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Its off-balance sheet “mysterious” items marked simply “other,” total to a whopping $737.5 billion – that’s almost three-quarters of an undefined $1 trillion at the largest bank in the U.S.

Then there is Bank of America. It has $1.85 trillion in assets on its balance sheet and equity capital of $212 billion. But [off its balance sheet it has another $1.5 trillion](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/Reports/UbprReport.aspx?rptCycleIds=120%2c114%2c107%2c101%2c86&rptid=283&idrssd=480228&peerGroupType=&supplemental=). Its “other” items listed off its balance sheet total to $450.9 billion.

With oil going negative recently, they have been exposed even more. Bloomberg today reported:

>For Wall Street’s biggest banks, negative oil has meant a frantic scramble over the past 24 hours to recalculate the value and riskiness of their trading books to account for a world in which oil can go negative. It has also literally broken the models that many traders rely on to calculate risk.  
>  
>The implications are enormous. Allowing for the possibility of negative prices has made some positions much riskier, exposing some banks and traders to potentially significant losses and triggering a rush to recalibrate that has exacerbated the wild swings in the markets.

1587575149.0,2020-04-22,wallstreetbets,fo7ar4t,Wonder how many jobs are gonna be lost for good because automated versions of their jobs are being implemented. Seems like a good time for businesses to trim the fat. Saves them a hell of a lot of money now and in the long term. Banks are making it pretty hard to talk to a rep now but u can use message centers where one rep can juggle several different conversations at once. Wonder if this is why unemployment is bullish—it shows that businesses have offloaded unneeded expenses.,t3_g5yjae,7
