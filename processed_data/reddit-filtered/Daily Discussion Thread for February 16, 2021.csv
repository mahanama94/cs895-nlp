They somehow got access to my email, password, and used my finger print to log in somehow.

This sick bastard even knew my mother’s maiden name and the name of my first childhood pet.

Then they used my Robinhood Debit card to buy a bunch of PLTR merchandise. Who would do something like that?

Anyways please refund my money ASAP, rent is due soon and I’m looking at a margin call.
