>Fun fact: Tesla is not part of the S&P 500, even though it‚Äôs now the number two car company on the planet. **Would the index look different if the galloping shares of Tesla were in the mix? Yes**.  
With a market cap of \~$140.6 billion at yesterday‚Äôs close, Tesla would be the 50th largest in the S&P (nestled between Nvidia and PayPal). At that level, every 1% move in the stock adds \~0.16 point to the S&P 500. Tesla, however, has been on a gargantuan run, up 86.5% YTD. **If it were in the S&P 500, it would have added roughly 13 points to the index, making it the second most influential stock this year**. The only other company contributing that many points is Microsoft which has added 15.4 pts, accounting for 85% of the index‚Äôs gain, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs historical movers function.  
  
>  
>The Russell 3000 index gives an idea of what the stock market leader board might look like -- the biggest point contributors to its YTD advance are Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet.  
>  
>Here‚Äôs the macro point: if Tesla joins the S&P 500, it‚Äôll be one more reason to look at the index as a different breed of equity animal. Elon Musk‚Äôs creation, like that of the other American titans, is about more than cars -- it‚Äôs about a platform business and building a moat around that business. Tesla has a 10-year head start on the industry, and can leverage that advantage in all sorts of areas related to cars, mobility, solar panels or efficient homes, as stock holder Ron Baron argued on CNBC earlier. If Tesla becomes a stable growth company, it could differentiate the S&P from its peers and support the index‚Äôs sticky and lofty valuations.   
>  
>N.B: Given Tesla‚Äôs prominence, its entry into the S&P seems inevitable, along with the index-fund buying such an event will engender. When is the big question. Tesla meets all the S&P‚Äôs requirements save for four consecutive quarters of positive earnings, and that might be true when 2Q results are reported in late July.",t3_eyoh7t,40

His point was in 10 years Tesla will sell 10 million cars a year. Right now they hope to set a record in 2020 with 500k in maxed out facilities. So they'd need to invest to build more factory capacity for 40x total cars or 38 more factories equal to the 2 they have today. OK possible but  highly unlikely.

When asked why Honda, Toyota, VW, etc... have to stand by and watch instead of compete his answer was they'd need to invest in brand new factories.
