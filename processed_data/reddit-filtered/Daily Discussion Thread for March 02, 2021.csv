They were only able to short while the price went up, so they could only try and keep it from going up, but not drive it down. Today they can. It’ll be tougher today. I’m just saying this so you’re not surprised or disillusioned. Just keep calm and enjoy the ride.

Here, see for yourself. Bottom Link, it's an excel sheet. Then go and look for GME. The restrictions end today.
