1572365383.0,2019-10-29,wallstreetbets,f5pqaxq,"I honestly hardly see a likely scenario where the market doesnt sell off tomorrow, at least a little bit.

Ways the market could rally:

* You get your quarter point, and JPow is super dovish when he speaks (The fed meeting minutes last time specifically said they would do the opposite of this)

* You get a half verse a quarter point cut?

Ways the market would want to correct:

* You get no cut at all

* You get a quarter point, but JPows rhetoric is much more hawkish (Minutes said the fed fears the market is pricing in way too many cuts, and they need to realign expectations)

* You get a cut, and Jpow tippy toes around further cuts (this seems to be apparently what the market has priced in, in which case this becomes a sell the news type of event)

The latter 2 scenarios are so much more likely than any of the others, I dont see how you're not at least hedging to the downside. Couple that with ""Earnings bad, global data bad, but Stonks go up"", and this fucking thing is going to make a decent move to the downside.",t3_doo98t,7
