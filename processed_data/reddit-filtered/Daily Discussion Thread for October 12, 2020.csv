Let me whip out the decoder ring for you - it's really fucking simple.

The VIX has plummeted because you've literally watched election volatility dry up before your eyes with the orange actions on twitter and the Rona diagnosis.  A loss by the incumbent candidate almost assures that big time helicopter money is coming for the American consumer.   Like 2.6T worth.

And there is NOTHING more that the American consumer likes to buy more of than shit off Amazon, and iPhones.  Period.  And THAT is going to trickle down to most other businesses that don't sell buggywhips.
