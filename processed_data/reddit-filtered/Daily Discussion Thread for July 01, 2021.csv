Wake up a bit before 6:30 to watch the stocks pre-market open.

Stock goes green : panic, realize that since you invested in it the stocks will eventually trade the opposite way and you'll lose money. Stare at your trading platform app 20303939 times a day

Stock goes red : panic, bite your nails hoping for it to climb. Check your trading platform 2020302235 times a day.

Get stressed, go to WSB for relief comedy and unintentional gambling intervention.

Find that one post where someone made 300k+ today.

Get upset that it wasn't you.

Lie to yourself, say you were gonna make that call. Beat yourself up about Stock inception.

Reason with yourself that the Stock will rise again and you don't want to miss it. 

Buy those calls.
