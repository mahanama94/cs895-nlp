Yesterday when I said I'm shorting SPX (on the back of change in Trump's rhetoric about china - he threatened them on Tuesday with new tariffs) I went long 0DTE puts and closed when we went to 13DMA (3096). I wouldn't feel comfortable holding weekly puts today.

This bounce makes me think that it's dangerous to bet on continuation of a bearish move.

>  
>By Andrew Cinko  
>  
>**It was a jolt to see the S&P 500 falling by as much as 1% midday yesterday, but it did no damage whatsoever**. And even though stocks are lower in early trading, today's happy headline about the possibility of the Dec. 15 tariff increase being delayed should ensure that Wednesday's drop has little carryover into today.  
>  
>During the pullback, the rising 20-day moving average was in no danger of being punctured. Rising S&P futures this morning means stocks will avoid making a run at that trend line, which has been a decent arbiter of short-term changes in direction since June.  
>  
>What yesterday's retreat did accomplish is remove the S&P 500's overbought signals from the 14-day RSI basis (though of course that may return today) and the 14-day stochastics measures. Both are minor positive developments in that they remove a bearish talking point, but don't necessarily clear the path for the bulls.**Small investors remain gun-shy of buying stocks at record highs -- that's clear from the bull-bear spread in the American Association of Individual Investors survey**. While sentiment has rebounded from August's depressed levels when recession was the talk of the town, there's probably only one way to ignite small investors' animal spirits: a trade deal. Until there's a definitive answer on that front, *small moves* will remain the most popular adjective for describing equities.",t3_dzhqjm,8

Market is in a fight now to prevent the correction. I'm watching the NASDAQ and its futures closely. I posted the crayons for it [last night](https://imgur.com/Q4ShbIq) and you can see how [it's developed today.](https://imgur.com/a/Rcknlu0) Now that we have broken below that support line we've traded most of the day today below it, and each time it's tried to shake it off it's been stopped. This is a bearish sign short-term. 

As I said, I'll be watching for it to start heading towards 8220, the second support. If we can climb back out and have a sustained consolidation or push back over the initial support, things may well be fine. But if we break below that second support, the next support is a bit farther down-- and as I've said, I would anticipate losing 8220 would begin the ""full"" correction in SPY to that 307ish mark I'm looking at as the bounce off to continue the bull run.

The 10/1 plunge from $298 to $287 was only 9 hourly candles. The 8/1 plunge from $300 to $284 was only 17 hourly candles...

My point is, in situations like we are in now teetering on dropping down. It happens so quick that if you aren’t preemptively in the trade you might miss the actual move. 

So like now, we are sitting around $310..we could wake up in 7-14 hourly candles and be sitting at $295. It’s because of this weird market dynamic we are in right now.
