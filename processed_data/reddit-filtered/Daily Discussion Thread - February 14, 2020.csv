In solidarity, here are the things I've done in the last two weeks:

- Bought TSLA 950c 2/7 for $46.50 (got in WAY late)
- Sold TSLA 950c 2/7 for $73.50
- Figured TSLA would have a sudden drop, and people would freak out thinking it had burst. Ordered TSLA 775p 2/7 for $9, but opening price the next morning was $10.80. TSLA hit the $710s at some point that day; those puts were up around 650%. Damn, missed out on doubling my account.
- Bought MSFT calls all over the place. Less-stupid and farther out though.
- Forgot my ""sudden drop"" logic, never set or even considered a stop price since I had completely bought into the hype. Still holding everything (I lost 1 contract MSFT 195c 2/14 expire; stupid buy anyway).

No shout-outs for my other dumbass plays because they were too small to matter.
