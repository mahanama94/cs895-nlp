1612281779.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glqtoet,"REPOST

So, let’s just rewind a few days.

Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun!

They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART;

No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It’s mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can’t get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own.

We are winning here. It really is that simple. If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don’t care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what’s necessary and finally get ours. We’ve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It’s time for change.

GME & AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.

LETS DO THIS!!! 💎🤲🏻💎🤲🏻💎",t3_layuxv,2402

I also got cancer (fucking stage 4) , had to stay at a job, couldn't get a diff job because of where I was and how pre-existing conditions were a thing (still can't get good life insurance).

Faced lots of financial struggles in my youth and into adulthood. Money struggles have lead to an inability to do so many things that I want to do (get a Masters). They've also lead to a painful divorce.

If my 5 shares have even a small chance of pissing off someone on Wall Street then I'll hold forever.

1612287185.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glr8hkb,"For those who didn't tune into Mark Cuban's Q&A on the other thread, here was his advice:

**HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS!**

The large dips are a result of brokers preventing/restricting the purchase of shares in $GME & $AMC. This forced the price down as demand was removed from the equation - forcing sellers to continually lower their price in order to find a buyer.

If we buy these marginal prices now, before all the brokerages reopen trading, we can force the price right back up, possibly further than it's already gone.",t3_layuxv,97
1612284395.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glr14pm,"I hope this comment doesn’t get lost in new.

TLDR; 💎🖐🏻🖐🏽🖐🏿

The goal of the hedge funds here is very clear. They’ve lowered the stock price to drive you into despair. As the price now increases (potentially back up to $300 by end of day) they are hoping you will sell when you hit your buy in. This is a strong play for them because it plays on natural human instinct.

In reality, they are still in deep trouble and they need you to sell. You shouldn’t think of holding today as any different than when you were holding last Friday.

The hedge funds are losing REAL money. They are losing interest on their shorts.

You are seeing theoretical losses. They materialize when you sell.",t3_layuxv,273

1612291983.0,2021-02-02,wallstreetbets,glrkp14,"To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:

All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.

Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).

But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:

«If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.»

This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?

They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.**

You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?

Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***«Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line».***

Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**.

**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?**

OR

We realise that this is a story that is still unfolding. We have some progressive people currently welding more power in office and policies. We have a government who wants 'Unity' and this is literally the only thing Ive seen bipartisan support for in my whole ass Doomer lifetime .

I can't guarantee anything. I cannot give financial advice. But the basic principal which is that if we hold onto these shares, HF will still need them as they are accumilating debt everyday

Thing is I knew this was going to happen. My gf ought amc at 14 and now shes pissed and panicking, I assured her everything will be fine.

My thoughts are currently not organized right now and I'm just blurring out words as much as I can before they fade into oblivion, but I gave it some thought on why I holding.

1. I've seen it rise and fall and (hopefully have) understood its potential. If what people say in here (especially Mr Cuban) are true I expect to see it go back up again to at least 250. Though I have reasonable doubt it'll go to Uranus.
2. If this GME thing falls, we all lose and probably things go back to normal, us plebs will be sitting here bitching and moaning about the unfairness and WS gets their last laugh. The logical choice for me is to sell now and still make some profit albeit not as much, but that would go against everything I believed in since I joined WSB, and I believe all you apes can evolve and kick HF ass and take back what belongs to you.
3. I believe when the whole corona virus thing is over, everything shoot back up, and especially because of how much support the relevant generation is showing, I believe its going to bounce back even more.

In conclusion, hold. At least I know I will.

That said, you will do all this again. You will go after WS and the next time you will be smarter. There was only one thing that messed you all up: RobinHood and the other zero commission brokers that everyone used didnt have enough capital to fund the fight. They let you down in a big way.
