I'm about to flip everything back on with slightly more lax settings and get the sub back in order.

I know it's easy to believe stories about us and buy into memes about how we're shills or whatever, but we turned that deluge of shitposts into a decent feed every day since 2016 because we enjoy contributing. Do me a favor and challenge the next person alleging something about us to provide proof. Ask them who would benefit the most from convincing a bunch of people that /r/wallstreetbets is compromised.

If you trust me, then believe me when I say things are good. There are no shenanigans. Things have changed around us and while we can always adapt, we can't compromise and appease people when we think they're asking us to do the wrong thing. I'd rather see other stock subs carry the torch than allow rule-breaking content solely to not upset someone. I'd like to think of WSB like a sports league subreddit (NFL, NHL) and the single-stock subs as teams. There's no reason for us to fight. They can plumb the depths of their sole interest, we can be generalists. We've always had high standards while simultaneously being kinda retarded and I don't want to lose that.

I hope that all the good work we did and still do isn't forgotten for low-information insults and conspiracy theories. Don't buy all the BS, nothing has changed on our end. Same mods (without the old shill mods), same rules, same effort.

Hell, if people are still convinced that we're somehow exerting control in nefarious ways I'd go so far as to livestream mod logs/spam submission queue.",t3_n63s48,1

1. Wait for earnings reports
2. If it seems like a red day in general, and
3. The stock just dumped after earnings, then
4. Buy as many calls as you possibly can for like 3 months from now that are already ITM or very close to it
5. Set your sell limit at 15% and walk away

Saves a lot of time frothing and worrying about the stock market and staring at a screen, and minimizes risk. Rinse and repeat.
