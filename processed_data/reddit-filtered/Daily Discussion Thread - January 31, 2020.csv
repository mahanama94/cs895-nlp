Based on the futures and ETFs traded in the US, China is expected to open down around -9% to -10%, so if they close anything above that magnitude will be a win and crush Yang. At this point, I think there's more potential for upside surprise (e.g., no news or news not as bad as expected). I also trust in Winnie's 1984 machine to manage the news coming out of China.
