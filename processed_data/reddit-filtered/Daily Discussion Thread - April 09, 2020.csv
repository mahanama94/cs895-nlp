the fed has failed in their regulatory mandate and has basically become the accommodation rubber stamp of the government who cannot maintain operations without increasing debt

why is this?

the government borrowers like municipalities and pension funds need to issue debt as part of their normal course of business, however they also need to hedge their duration and this is where the banks fuck them and make government borrowers their bitches

nevertheless these banks need lower rates than they collect from government borrowers in order to be profitable, hence the inevitable crash into zero percent rates required to sustain the big sell side banks, lending to banks at zero percent should be considered a chapter 11 type event and come with administration by the fed until solvent again with intervention-free market rates

essentially every sell side firm needs to be put into administration and reorganized immediately as the existence of the unlimited liabilities they create threatens national security

the fed should be a peace officer in the banking system and not act like Pablo Escobar by insuring the loses of private bond issuers, if the fed had not accommodated unlimited fiscal deficits then this financial catastrophy would not have happened in the first place
