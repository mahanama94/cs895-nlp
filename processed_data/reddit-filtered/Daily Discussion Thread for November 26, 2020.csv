1606423203.0,2020-11-26,wallstreetbets,gdp83j8,"10 years ago I was strung out on heroin. 5 years ago I was working shitty jobs and still strung out on oxy, doing up to 300mg a day when I could afford it. \~3 years ago I got fired from a job and disrespected in a bad way by a boss, and I wanted to get back at him. I rode spite like rocket, started my own business competing with him. I would tell myself I wouldn't stop until I stole every customer from him. Until he starved. Last year he sold his company and now I get nothing but complaining customers of his that become my returning customers. My business comes up on Google at #1 for what I optimized it for. I haven't touched an opiate in 2 years. I will make a clean six figures in 2021 for the first time in my life. I am about to hire employees for the first time because I'm overwhelmed. I don't owe nobody shit and have nobody to answer to but myself for the first time in my life.   


If you are in a shitty situation, just know you can turn it around and ride that anger, that spite, those doubts, all the way up. You can transmute that shit like an alchemist and eat it as fuel. I came from nothing, a poor single mother, no college, and now I'll never have to go back to that and when I have kids they'll never have to be in that place. Fucking changed the destiny of my lineage with my big swinging dick in my hand. Anybody can do it. You can't have the light without the dark.

Come Dec 1 the S&P500 Index funds can own TSLA Shares. They can‚Äôt own in November (as a full autist I spent this morning reading the largest fund prospectuses, rules, and additional info). 

There‚Äôs $6Trillion in weighted index funds. 

TSLA will represent a 1.5% weighting of the S&P500 index when added (at $560-575/share). That means they have to buy $90Billion in TSLA shares on the open market starting Dec 1. That‚Äôs 16.5% of all TSLA shares. (156Mill shares out of 947.9Mill total shares)

The 12/4 calls expire before the funds have to finish the buying spree the 12/24 are too far out and time is money. 

12/11 gives us retards 10 trading days in December to ride the Mr.  fund buyer like our bottom bitch.

Supply/demand is about to skyrocket again on TSLA. Take 16.5% of a float off the table and it drives up the price. 15% move up from 574 is 660.

I‚Äôm going in Friday. You guys want to do another remind me in 2 weeks? Here:  ON DECEMBER 10 TESLA WILL BE 750. 

Since I‚Äôm a retard, tell me how I‚Äôm wrong. Here are some retard research links

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/25/heres-whats-pushing-tesla-stock-toward-600-and-bey/

By the way, in September 8, Investopia said ‚ÄúETSY being added to the S&P 500 isn‚Äôt worth it. There‚Äôs little upside here in the short term‚Äù (it‚Äôs up 32% in 11 weeks).

Fuck the smart research investment reporters and guys like Cramer. You guys are the best advice ever.
