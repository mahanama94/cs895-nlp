What an astute observation. Why don’t you go join the literal thousands of other people who came to the same conclusion and either lost money shorting or missed out on gains. 

Call it whatever you want, people have been doubting TSLA since day 1, but this shit doesn’t fucking stop.

Maybe you people are right. Maybe it will collapse eventually. But until then you’re wrong and just sound like salty losers. 

I’m not even a TSLA holder, in fact I’ve lost money in totality on TSLA calls but there comes a point when it’s time to accept reality, buy calls, and stfu about fundamentals because it’s abundantly evident that people don’t give it a shit what the fundamentals are.
