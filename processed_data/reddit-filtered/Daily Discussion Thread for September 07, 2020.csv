Contrary to your situation, sometimes you're trying to just grind and people are  always asking you to do things. Sometimes you're not always invested in what they want to do which is fine, naturally people get butt hurt if you neglect too many invites.

Girlfriends are obviously the worst offenders. They will tell you they want you to succeed but interrupt your grind with the most pointless events on a weekly/bi-weekly basis.

Just remember the grass isnt always greener on the other side, but sometimes you DO need to change up something in your daily life to maintain your sanity.

I would suggest putting an expiry date on your grind and then move on to filling other voids in your life. You can always return to working your ass off.",t1_g4bqhjf,13
