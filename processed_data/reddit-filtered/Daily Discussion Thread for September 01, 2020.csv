The Intel Tiger Lake announcement is about to begin. 

The live stream starts. A lone mic in front of a dark blue curtain is all that can be seen. 

Bob Intel, CEO of Intel, descends via tight wire from the rafters like Lady Gaga in that one super bowl half time show a few years ago. 

Silence. Utter, deafening silence. 

Bob takes the mic and clears his throat. A man in the audience kills himself and his family because he can‚Äôt take the anticipation. 

*‚ÄùLadies, Gentlemen. Investors. We have bought the moon.‚Äù*

The curtain falls. The moon shows through a window behind the stage. A large *Intel* logo across its center.

INTC explodes to $100
