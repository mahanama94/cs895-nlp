1583529767.0,2020-03-06,wallstreetbets,fjoktj9,"So something interesting happened with that late move today. Unlike the previous big up days this week, VIX futures actually dropped correspondingly. Before what was happening is when we go up, VIX futures dropped a bit but when we went down, VIX futures spiked. This means people were super eager to buy the front 2 months futures at all times. As I was saying yesterday this also accounted for the huge overnight drop the last 2 days since VIX futures were bid so high (hence why VXX and TVIX started up like so high today at the open). 

The fact that VIX futures dropped in a usual correlated way with the up move end of day is kinda good. It's still super high but it gives it a higher chance for a less volatile week next week and some stability.  It's also a slightly positive sign for bulls next week. The less demand for VIX futures, the better chance the market goes up. A lot of algos have ES, VIX futures, and the 10 year rate as 3 huge factors in how they trade since they are usually correlated. 

Oh also my brothers friends dad got the cornavirus.....my brother isn't old enough to trade though.  They are probably gonna shut down his school which is kinda stupid imo but I guess they want to be safe.

‚ÄúThe less I cared about whether or not I was wrong, the clearer things became, making it much easier to move in and out of positions, cutting my losses short to make myself mentally available to take the next opportunity.‚Äù -Mark Douglas

‚ÄúYou need to ‚Äòchange your thinking‚Äô. The goal is to reach a ‚Äòcare-free state of mind‚Äô.¬†When a pattern presents itself, don‚Äôt think. There‚Äôs nothing to think about. Take the trade because you have an edge. Then odds, probability and your risk control mechanisms will take care of everything. In the end, the key is to learn more about yourself. The most important lesson though is the importance of viewing every single trade as being part of a series of trades.‚Äù -Mark Douglas""

""In a narrow market when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range, there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be- up or down. The thing to do is watch the market, read the tape to determine the limits of the get-nowhere prices, and make up your mind that you will not take up interest until the price breaks through the limit in either direction.""- Jesse Livermore

""When I put on a trade, all I expect is that something will happen.""- Mark Douglas""Ninety-five percent of the trading errors you are likely to make‚Äîcausing the money to just evaporate before your eyes‚Äîwill stem from your attitudes about being wrong, losing money, missing out, and leaving money on the table. What I call the four primary trading fears.""- Mark Douglas

""We need to¬†be rigid in our rules so that we gain a sense of self-trust that can, and will always, protect us in an¬†environment that has few, if any, boundaries. We need to be flexible in our expectations so we can¬†perceive, with the greatest degree of clarity and objectivity, what the market is communicating to us¬†from its perspective.""- Mark Douglas""It always seems the best trades are the small ones you don't care about. In that case, make them all small to take your emotions out of the equation and let the power of the¬†trend¬†and whatever edge you use do its thing.""

""When dealing with options, using stops take you out of the trade entirely. You never really know what the market will give you on any given day. If one assumes a 100% loss right from the start, and sizes their position appropriately, you can let the position expire painlessly but still have a position to take advantage of if something crazy happens within your option timeframe.""

""Despite your best efforts, you never really know which edges are going to work and which aren't so stop trying to predict outcomes. By taking every edge, you increase your sample size of trades, which in turn gives whatever edge you are using ample opportunity to play itself out in your favor, just like the casinos.""- Mark Douglas

""It is exactly like options, trial and error, not getting stuck, bifurcating when necessary but keeping a sense of broad freedom and opportunism. Trial and error is freedom.‚Äù- Nassim Taleb¬†¬†

""Markets are simple in that $1 in and $1 dollar out at end of day only generate trading volatility but does little to push prices higher. Markets need buyers who are willing to hold invesments overnight to sustain price moves. When these are absent, markets drop until levels are reached when these same buyers feel prices and conditions are attractive enough to hold investments longer term.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen much correlation between good trading and intelligence. Some outstanding traders are quite intelligent, but a few aren‚Äôt. Many outstanding intelligent people are horrible traders. Average intelligence is enough. Beyond that, emotional makeup is more important.‚Äù- Mark Douglas

‚ÄúWhy do you think unsuccessful traders are obsessed with market analysis? They crave the sense of certainty that analysis appears to give them. Although few would admit it, the truth is that the typical trader wants to be right on every single trade. He is desperately trying to create certainty where it just doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù ‚Äì Mark Douglas

Tune out the intraday noise. Use end-of-day, week or month as a guage for the general sentiment of your stock within the timeframe you're playing.Randori is a term used in Japanese martial arts to describe free-style practice. The term literally means ""chaos taking"" or ""grasping freedom,"" implying a freedom from the structured practice of kata. Randori may be contrasted with kata, as two potentially complementary types of training.

""The goal of the trader, paradoxically, is not to make money. The goal is to trade well.""- Alexander Elder

If markets are ""rigged"" or not really doesn't matter. Making money consistently from what the market has to offer is what matters.

It's one thing to have an answer for everything. The creative have a question for everything.The market moves in waves that can last anywhere from weeks to months. Then a correction or setback starts, which can last anywhere from 5 to 8 weeks or even as long at 4 to 6 months.- Dan Zanger

History shows 3 out of 4¬†stocks move¬†in the same direction as the overall¬†market, either up or down. So if you buy¬†stocks¬†when the¬†market¬†is trending higher, you have a 75% chance of being right. But if you buy when the¬†market¬†is trending lower, you have a 75% chance of being wrong.- IBD

On average, every month has about 22 trading days. Based on the ebb and flow of market action, trending up/down, to range-bound, there will be 3-5 days great for trading with less risk, another 3-5 days great for trading with manageable risk. So based on this, one only needs to trade 5-7 days or 1/3 of all trading time in a month. Be patient.Sentiment Questions: Are dips being bought or sold? Are pops being bought or sold? Are the general market moves tight orderly or loose? Is the market making higher highs, lower lows or trading within a range?¬†How are ¬†the previous questions also playing out in other time frames?¬†The real challenge is to exploit the winning periods and limit the damage during the losing periods.- Peter BrandtHow do you know when you're in a bull market? -- whenever you get out, you must pay up to get back in- Peter Brandt¬†The 5 Fundamental Truths of Trading:

1. Anything can happen.
2. You don‚Äôt need to know what is going to happen next to make money.
3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of¬†variables that define an edge.
4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing¬†happening over another.
5. Every moment in the market is unique.The 7 Principles of Consistency:
6. I objectively identify my edges.
7. I predefine the risk of every trade.
8. I completely accept the risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.
9. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.
10. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.
11. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors.
12. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success¬†and, therefore, I never violate them.",t3_febypd,22
