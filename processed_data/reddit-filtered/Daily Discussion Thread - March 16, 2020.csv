* [Robinhood Crash Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjk4va/preemptive_robinhood_crash_megathread_4_the). All RH complaints go there.

* If the market is halted/shut down on your expy date, you **cannot** trade your options and they will expire worthless if they're OTM. If they're ITM, you *can* exercise them. 

* If short selling is banned, you can  still trade your options (referencing when this happened in 2008). However, [pricing and liquidity is going to change](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi%3Fdb_name%3DACE09%26paper_id%3D143&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjK8qj3-57oAhUImHIEHd-bDo4QFnoECAUQAg&usg=AOvVaw0kPIDDUZiHl2mBlgWVyMGz).

* [Market circuit breakers](https://i.imgur.com/QiJqDkg.jpg)

* Sourceless fear mongering is not allowed and will result in a **permanent ban**. Provide sources for your claims, at least to us mods FIRST, or don't post it.

* On a happy note, [the WSB Live Charity Stream](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhh5rs/the_wsb_charity_live_stream_for_autism_wednesday) is on Wednesday.

EDIT: On fear mongering; **You are being targeted** with FUD (Fear, Uncertianty, Doubt) posts by bad actors. Dozens of posts an hour. Don't ever believe -any- of it. We're removing it as fast as we can. Please report it when you see it. Bans are being given with no remorse so don't even think about any *""My X works for Y and everything is being shutdown.

I kept watching as it went up and up, getting more and more excited for cheap puts as it climbed. I had my finger on the button waiting to press it and lock in the sweet tendies I knew would be coming in the following weeks.

Then suddenly at about 3:55 I knocked over my glass of water, it streamed down the back of my desk on to the outlet and all over the power strip my computer is plugged into. I began to panic, but I held fast. Praying that my computer didn't shut off I continued to stare at the screen watching the puts get cheaper and cheaper. I began to hear a slight sizzling behind my desk, but I needed these puts at the cheapest price possible. I told my self the sizzling was just my imagination. I thought ""Maybe this is a sign I shouldn't buy these puts?"" I pondered this for a moment, but only a moment before I threw a middle finger to God and pressed the buy button to buy 35 SPY puts at 3:59.

Immediately after it went through I unplugged everything from the outlet and realized I probably have a gambling problem, but now at least this morning I have a gambling problem and some sweet sweet tendies.

That is the third worst daily percentage loss in US stock market *history*.

It‚Äôs worse than any daily percentage loss seen during ‚Äò08 (worst day in ‚Äò08 was **SPX -9.04%** on October 15th, 2008).

Today‚Äôs close was also worse than the losses experienced on March 9th (now only the first Black Monday of 2020, **SPX -7.6%**) and March 12th (the Black Thursday of 2020, **SPX -9.51%**).

The only two days that saw even larger daily percentage losses were:

2. October 28th, 1929 (during the Crash of ‚Äò29, **SPX -12.34%**)
1. October 19th, 1987 (Black Monday ‚Äò87, **SPX -20.47%**)

Absolutely unbelievable. We are experiencing a seminal moment in human history, lads.

Win or lose, know that the coronapocalypse + stock market crash of 2020 will be written about in college textbooks, discussed at academic conferences, and immortalized by best-selling novels‚Äîfor the rest of humanity‚Äôs existence.

And, what‚Äôs more is that *all of us here today have the high honor of living through this landmark moment in time.*

1584408454.0,2020-03-16,wallstreetbets,fkpew17,"Dont even think about buying into this market until we're at least  testing the 5 year lows around spy $190.  We are on the fast track there and the only thing that could stop it is a decline in daily new cases.  Look at the charts, the daily rate clearly shows we're nowhere near slowing.  This makes perfect sense, everyone infected in the airport crowds and bars and restaurants and casinos etc over the weekend wont even start to seek testing for another 4-7 days, and probably wont progress far enough to get one for at least 10 days. We have at least 2 weeks before we can even begin to assess whether the universal shelter in place is having effevt.

Further, the 2007-2009 peak to trough was 50%, the peak here is spy $340, so as low as $170 seems extremely plausible.

 Guys, I dont see any reason why we wont get spy 190 as soon as Wednesday, certainly within the remainder of this week or next.   4/3 puts haven't even started relative to where they'll be by a week out from expiry, zero doubt. 

It is so painfully obvious what is going on and you dumbfounded dumbshits are in denial.  They STILL can't tell us how many tests have been or can be done, they STILL cant give us any real data at all because of this, and oh by the way they STILL cant say they can meet the coming demand for intubators and ICU beds, and they STILL cant figure out how to do travel screening.  Most of all, DEVIN NUNES REPRESENTS THE MINDSET OF ALL BOOMERS.  Boomers have NEVER had to sacrifice for the common good, they are irretrievably selfish.
