1616607288.0,2021-03-24,wallstreetbets,gs2m1ou,"What's happened the past 2 months is basically a low volatility version (i.e. polar opposite in terms of panic levels) of what we saw a year ago during the Covid recession.

There's lots of sector rotation going on every day as markets attempt to find bottoms on different asset prices.  But there's no panic.

Problem is just so many changes are occuring at once; i.e. gold/silver are being displaced by B T C as a speculative alternative to fiat while value and growth stocks are fighting for positioning.

So we're seeing such jerky action (yesterday was a rotation to cloud stocks from more speculative EVs/chips); I doubt we see anything fall big from here (except maybe metals if the thing we don't talk about goes to like $300k).

Just feels like we're sort of just in limbo until a big wave of buying pushes some stuff to break out.  And of course the 10 year looks like it's finally stabilizing with a yield somewhere in the range of 1.6-1.7 but we won't know for sure until a few weeks passes.",t3_mc1zp9,19

1616587115.0,2021-03-24,wallstreetbets,gs1e5ct,"So someone help me if I'm missing something. APHA and TLRY plan to merge into TLRY ticker, and APHA shareholders with get 0.83 TLRY shares for owning 1 APHA share (83/100).

 Considering APHA is currently at $18.12, TLRY at $23.22, shouldn't everyone just buy APHA instead of TLRY since 83% of $23.22 is $19.27, so you basically get a discount by just stocking up on APHA if you're longer holding it.

 Or am I missing something, I'm kind of retarded?",t3_mc1zp9,10
