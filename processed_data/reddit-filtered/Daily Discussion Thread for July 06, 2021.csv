1625571717.0,2021-07-06,wallstreetbets,h4875bq,"My hypotheses on China's tech crackdown:

1. Big tech has too much monopoly power. American politicians think Amazon, Facebook, Uber, etc. are too powerful. Chinese politicians think Alibaba, Didi, etc. are too powerful. But China's communist government has the will and ability to do something about it (compared to the US's capitalist or socialist-lite government). This is bearish for the stocks.

2. China is trying to spy on people. Their cybersecurity reviews are to install backdoor spy software, not protect people's privacy. It seems like they would just do it in secret without making a big public fuss though. I'm pretty sure they've been doing this for years so this doesn't seem new.

3. China wants a bigger cut of these companies' profit. The government is indirectly nationalizing these companies (taking more of the company's future cash flows without putting up capital). It's like how the US wants to raise taxes on US corporations. This is bearish short term if they are diluting foreign owners' ownership percentage, but bullish in the long term (since they'll start propping up the companies they now own).

4. Chinese tech entrepreneurs love capitalism and have gotten too politically active. Communist party leaders want to put them in their place. This is bullish since all those companies have to do is kiss the ring and they'll go back to making money. This makes sense since they're sabre rattling and taking a victory lap in light of their communist anniversary.
