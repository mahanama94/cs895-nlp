Dared defy the longs

I bought some new  🕵️‍♀️  puts

Along came this song

From when the trade war fought

An orange-faced devil

His army of bulls

At his hooves did they revel

They came after me

With phase 1 deal complete

Broke down my puts

And they kicked in my teeth

While the bull gang’s horns

Minced our tender meat

And so cried the bitch bear

This bull trap is neat!

Toss a coin to your bitch bear

O’ Rally of Plenty

O’ Rally of Plenty

O’

Toss a coin to your bitch bear

O’ Rally of Plenty

At the edge of the world

Fight the mighty Fed

That bashes and breaks you

Til your account's dead

They made every bear

Soon regret their flair

High up on the Repo

All the bulls came

They wiped out our best

Bears are now depressed

Buying puts is insanity

So give them a rest

That’s my epic tale

Not QE prevailed

Defeated the bear gang

Now pity my fail

Toss a coin to your bitch bear

O’ Rally of Plenty

O’ Rally of Plenty

O’",t3_ep0xus,13
