In my state (all states?) the pandemic unemployment ran out like 2 months ago. Which means in my area, there are a lot of people who literally have 0 income right now.

I live in a ""luxury"" apartment complex in a good part of town in the burbs of a major city. You know the type. Anyway, it's a safe part of town.

Like 2 weeks ago, we started getting an absolute fuckton of break-ins in my complex. Apartments getting ransacked, car windows being broken, etc. I grew up in the ghetto, so it doesn't scare me personally, but it's weird af to be happening here. There are like community notices and police bulletins about a massive spike in robberies, and I'm in a gay ritzy part of town. Cops strollin everywhere. And if it's happening here, it's gotta be happening everywhere. 

I dunno boys. I feel like that whole ""4 meals away from anarchy"" thing is a real consideration. I don't know wtf the government thought would happen. Pandemic shits on the economy, shit closes down, like 1/3 of all small businesses fail, and they give us... One $1,200 check? And unemployment that ran out months ago?

I just wanted to point out that the reason you're seeing fewer gain/loss robinhood charts is because we took it to heart when you got mad last week about ""positions or gtfo"" not being enforced and [made a bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/VisualMod/comments/) that spams all robinhood charts if they don't include position information or have a number greater than absolute value of 2,500 in them.

If you were too look at the delinquency rates from FRED they dont actually look bad compared to a couple of years ago, it actually shows that delinquency is down from 2016.

Why is that?

Because the cares act allows the banks to stash the delinquencies related to covid in another ""box"" on their quarterly call reports and these amounts are confidential. . . .

> Beginning with the June 30, 2020, report date, institutions should report 
the total number of loans outstanding that have been modified under Section 4013 and the outstanding 
balance of these loans in Call Report Schedule RC-C, Part I, Loans and Leases, Memorandum
