These negotiations are between Mnuchin (White House) and Pelosi (Democratic controlled House). The last offers we know of were $1.6T on Mnuchin's side and $2.2T on Pelosi's side... both rejected. Therefore, any new counterproposal being offered by Mnuchin at this time must be *higher* than $1.6T to have a chance of success... hence $1.8T. According to Kudlow, that counterproposal already has the thumbs up from mango and they are putting the ""final touches"" on it.  


What this deal ignores though is that it has to get through the GOP controlled Senate. I honestly don't think a package of $1.8T is going to have the votes required to pass in the Senate. And if that's the case, then the whole rally has just been a big bull trap. Which it is.",t3_j7wdaz,13
