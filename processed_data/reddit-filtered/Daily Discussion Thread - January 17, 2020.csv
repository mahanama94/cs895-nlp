Excerpted from the IMA fourth quarter 2019 letter to clients.

The stock market marched higher for the year even though US companies as a whole did not become more valuable, just more expensive, as earnings failed to grow from 2018 to 2019. Earnings are estimated to be up about 5% for 2020 (though these estimates are usually revised down as the year progresses). If you look at the quality of this non-growth, then the rose-tinted glasses of the average stock market investor quickly prove inadequate. Corporate debt is up 5% in 2019, and a good chunk of the increase went into stock buybacks. As stocks become more expensive their benefit from earnings per share growth diminishes.

The US economy grew about 4% in 2019 ‚Äì good news, except that our national debt grew about 5.6%, or about $1.3 trillion; our debt to GDP is over 100%; and paradoxically, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped from 2.6% to 1.9%. Maybe not paradoxically: The Federal Reserve went from a faint attempt of quantitative tightening (it did not even raise rates, it just talked about raising them) starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, which caused stock market to have a mini crash a year ago, to quantitative easing in the second half of 2019, which arguably caused the market to go up.",t3_epyz0g,5
