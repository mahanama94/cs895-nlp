I've been in it since it was sub $10 and have taken some profits. Nothing HUGE because I wanted to see where it was going, but I'm kind of liking how things are looking pre-tlry merger. 

I know APHA likely doesn't NEED tlry from the way things look...but hear me out. I know big tobacco has been planning for this day to come. If these small companies want to survive and control market share once weed is legalized...they're really going to need as much capital and credit as they can get their hands on.

I foresee Apple-like lawsuits about everything from packaging to manufacturing processes to biological IP for cultivation and even plant genetics. The corn industry and tobacco are two prime examples of how big subsidized corps can drive out smaller companies.

This is one of the main reasons I'm personally interested in seeing the merger go through. A company like SNDL will get all the press right now...but the bigger companies or companies preparing to battle once they get into the legal market are the ones I can see making it.",t3_m5hbpf,30

1615807323.0,2021-03-15,wallstreetbets,gr02h4d,"Okay so doing the rough math. 127.5 million people received the $1,200 stimulus check last year. This time only those making under $75k a year will receive the full $1400 check, and then it diminishes gradually up to the income cap of $100,000/year. Only 9% of Americans make more than $100k/year, so roughly 11,475,000 of the 127,500,00 who got the last check don't qualify at all for this check. Roughly another 8% make between $75k-$100k a year, so 10 million who only receive partial checks. If you average out the reduced payments for those who fall between 75k and 100k and say that this totals somewhere around an additional 5 million or so less total disbursements (again, a rough average) we can say that something roughly like 110 million $1,400 checks will be sent out to the public this time around. 110 million times $1,400 = $154 Billion. 

So in conclusion, we will see a $134,600,000,000 buy order for GME, accounting for roughly 10% or $15,400,000,000 going into that-which-shall-not-be-named (the digital krugerrand).
