Ok, sell half of what I'm still holding. Then I always keep 2 or 3 shares of everything I've bought, just in case it moons to $300. If it goes up from the initial 100% increase, I adjust my sell limits accordingly. This is just my method. Best of luck fellow apes!!

1623322199.0,2021-06-10,wallstreetbets,h19jxwj,"Stock futures are mixed, with the Nasdaq down 0.2% and Dow Industrials up 0.3%. S&P 500 is up 0.1%, still not yet at the all-time high set on May 7. That‚Äôs as of 0630.

Today is all about inflation. May‚Äôs CPI report drops at 0830, with economists expecting a rise of 4.7% year-over-year. The core CPI figure is expected to come in at 3.5% YoY Both of these would be increases from April (4.2% and 3%, respectively).

Investors have been waiting for this report for awhile, which explains the subdued volumes we‚Äôve seen all week. The concern of course is that the CPI comes in well ahead of forecasts, showing the Fed is losing the inflation battle (or maybe the battle convincing people this is all transitory). That will lead to concerns the Fed will be forced to raise rates sooner.

Markets will tell the story of course. The question is, if there is a sell-off, would it be an opportunity to buy? I‚Äôll discuss this in the audio. Not gonna type it out.

We also have initial jobless claims at 0830, but expect that to be drowned out.

Worth keeping an eye on Fed futures contracts. This will give an idea of when the market is anticipating the Fed to crack and raise rates. There‚Äôs a contrarian trade there as well, if you believe the Fed will hold fast to their plan to not raise until 2023.

But then if you believe the Fed you probably have bigger issues, no offense.",t3_nwjtth,41
