Some of the technical indicators are looking pretty precarious for smallcaps, but the whole thing looks like pretty classic ‘risk off.’ Growth stocks and small caps are selling off while safe haven assets like bonds are gaining.

It’s not entirely clear what prompted this move. Lots of noise on that front. Not seeing any particularly convincing arguments either.

Ultimately the environment is still conducive for risk-taking. Stocks should benefit from this, as they have for the last 12 months.
