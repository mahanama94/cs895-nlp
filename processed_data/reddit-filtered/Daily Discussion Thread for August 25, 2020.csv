We already know he won't be talking about using yield curve control anytime soon. We also know the Fed is dumping treasuries on the market increased supply, but also buying to inflate the balance sheet. 

But the real problem is the move to let inflation float higher toward 4%, which makes debt less appealing to hold, which sucks for long dated treasuries. Extra worse, it means longer term they'll have to raise rates to counter the higher inflation. However, it also means they'll hold off on that move for longer.

The real question then is, will the inflation they're measuring via CPI actually reflect the reality of assets like houses and cars, where inflation is already spiking?
