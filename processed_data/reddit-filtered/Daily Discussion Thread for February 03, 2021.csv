Spend the money you can only loose guys, no life savings and stuff. 

We were in this together, we had couple of rough days, i know how the psychology works, i am in my last year of medicine. It will eat you up from inside when you see the numbers falling.

We all new from the beginning its all or nothing. So don't sell and hold. We win or we loose. We are in this together. Atleast we can say at the end we tried our best. Lets these guys or bots say whatever they want, if we really stay together, we can win this. 

For the heck of it if it doesn't work out, when the movie comes out, we can stay we were the once who tried against the bully suits.

We all new from the beginning its all or nothing. So don't sell and hold. We win or we loose. We are in this together. Atleast we can say at the end we tried our best. Lets these guys or bots say whatever they want, if we really stay together, we can win this.

Not only do you have hedge funds scrambling and trying to make the GME stock go down in worth, but you got people like **Mark Cuban actively telling you to hold the line and to keep buying GME when you can if you can afford it.**

&#x200B;

***The whole world is helping you. Everyone around the world is buying GME with you to fuck over hedge funds.***

&#x200B;

This isn't just about money, this is about taking back what hedge funds are constantly stealing from regular people through their bullshit shorting. This is *bigger* than just money; *this is about sending a message that you won't stand for shorting or hedge funders stealing money and betting on people's lives getting ruined.*

&#x200B;

***Everyone's rooting for you guys.***

&#x200B;

The hedge funders are going to try and pull every trick in the book to try and make you buy other stocks that aren't being shorted, or to make you think you're losing.

&#x200B;

**Don't fall for the tricks.** Hold the line and buy more GME if you can afford to do so. If you have to find another app or anything to be able to buy more GME do it as soon as you can, but my God, *buy more GME and hold the line.*

&#x200B;

**The world believes in you. We're all rooting for you to take these hedge funders down.**

I mean it'd make sense if:

-We didn't know to expect artificial manipulation to lower the price

-We didn't know the hedgies and friends were going to do everything to try and psyche us out since this is largely a psychological game.

Volume is low.

They still want you to sell your apparently ""worthless"" shares they don't need? Wut?

This was never about a steady rise in price this was about forcing a squeeze that causes the price to explode and go to the moon. 

*IT'S IN THE MEME, PEOPLE!*

**SPEND WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD**
(no financial advice ever offered I'm just a dumb ape)

**BUY THE DIPS IF YOU WANT**

**HOLD THE SHARES WITH DIAMOND HANDS**
