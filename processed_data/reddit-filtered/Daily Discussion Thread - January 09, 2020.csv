i started trading with 250 bucks last year when your stock was at $140. i worked a shit job in my major and i put $20 into my account every paycheck. since i'm completely an autist, i made 250 into 1k. 1k into 2k. 2k into 4k. and here we are a year later, 250 to 9k. 

daddy elon: yesterday i did a dumb. when your daddy strong stock was going back and forth between 498 and 495, i bought my first Big Boy Call at 97.5. then the stock adjusted to 989. because, again i'm a fucking autist, i didn't lose the full 350. but that's the first time i've lost more than 115 in a day. i'm sure my fellow autists think that's a super cute statement but 250 to 9k is a rags to bitches story. my RH ain't red much.

daddy elon. please use your Strong Daddy powers. because every fucking cent this dipshit stock we're all riding the dick of goes up? i get like 12 bucks. 

i've been a good boy this year and santa brought me new brakes for my car but my tires are bald. daddy elon, i don't want to die in a car crash. but the ""black, round, holds air"" option for tires starts at 350. 

daddy elon. i have one late christmas wish. every day for almost the entire last 365 -- i've checked my account at 9:30 and you've sprayed thick wads of tendies all over me. sometimes i'm at work when you do it and it's super embarrassing but i'm still proud when i walk out for a smoke covered in your tendies. i made a Big Boy bet. just like you'd want me to: when i was financially stable enough to be able to take a 1k loss. and i am. 

but daddy elon. i'm not going to take a 1k loss. and i want you to spray me so god damned hard in tendies that i can't fucking move. 

also hey congrats on your bby. between you and grimes that kid is going to be emotionally detached as fuck but also rich af.
