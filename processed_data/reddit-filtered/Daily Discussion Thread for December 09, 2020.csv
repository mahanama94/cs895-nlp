AbCellera is the latest IPO backed by Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR), the big-data analytics company that went public in September via a direct listing. Shares of Palantir have nearly tripled from their $10 IPO price and are trading at $28.42.

The Vancouver, British Columbia–based AbCellera reported $1.9 million in income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, compared with $570,000 in losses for the same period in 2019. Revenue tripled to $25.2 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30 from $8.4 million in 2019.


AbCellera is expected to price its IPO on Thursday, Dec. 10, and trade the following day. The company is offering 23 million shares at $14 to $17 each and could raise $391 million at the top of its expected range. It is slated to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker ABCL.

The only thing suckers buying DASH will get are losses unless they're able to unload the bag to a bigger sucker before the stock tanks.
