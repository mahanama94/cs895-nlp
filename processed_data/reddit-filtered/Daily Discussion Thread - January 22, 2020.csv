 12:45 ET - Investors have been curious about  Virgin Galactic's role in the space economy as its market cap increases,  according to Morgan Stanley, which initiated the company's rating at  overweight. Shares of the Richard Branson-owned company are up 8.3%.  ""Lately, we are having more conversations on SPCE than any other US  stock in our coverage with the possible exception of Tesla,"" Morgan  Stanley says. Investors are tracking the company as it is slated to have  its first commercial flight by year end, according to the analysts.  They also particularly appreciate the opportunity in high-speed  point-to-point air travel, the firm says.
