1600082105.0,2020-09-14,wallstreetbets,g57xgsf,"i was born and raised in south phoenix and lived here my whole life, almost 30 years. while i love this neighborhood and i wouldn't live anywhere else, i understand that it is the ugliest, dirtiest, poorest and most ghetto part of metropolitan phoenix (maybe Maryvalle is worse now that i think about it). nothing good has ever came from this neighborhood except maybe some rapper in laveen that got shot and killed a few years ago, idk if he was any good, rap isn't my thing. anyway, my point is that that the schools suck, crime sucks, the houses are all old and the rare new construction is cheaply made.

so when i hear a friend of mine made 5 figures on NKLA calls i investigate the company. and lo and behold it's headquarters are right here in my neck of the woods. 40th street and broadway. when i tell you that this industrial park is in one of the worst parts of town i mean that there are hookers walking up and down this area of broadway road every night, boarded up houses with shot up facades, vacant lots behind tagged alleys with burned cactus that some poor tweaker tried to light up to stay warm during winter.

i drove by a few weeks ago on a random wednesday afternoon and the parking lot was less than a quarter full of cars. a ""delivery entrance"" that was taped off for some reason, and no real sign of life. 

i'm not some huge shortseller like hindenburg i'm just their neighbor, and no multi-billion dollar tech startup is gonna be here no matter how cheap the real estate is.

10 upvotes and i'll go walk into their front office and ask for a job application and say ""i want to be the guy that pushes the cars down the hill""
