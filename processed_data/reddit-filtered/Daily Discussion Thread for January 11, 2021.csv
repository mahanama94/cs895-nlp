B) Auto-post a dossier of the user's history if they're posting a DD thread (yes, that's like 4 automatic bot replies to every single submission. I know) highlighting the subs they visit, WSB activity, and any recent large gaps in user history.

Earlier this morning the trading volume seemed quite high and it was   really well until a sudden drop where it now can't break 19.50. Conveniently Melvin has a large amount of Put calls expiring this week for below $20 and $24? Look i get that we cry market manipulation too much, but this just seems a bit too fishy altogether imo.

Also check out the iborrowdesk. Before haters give out to me I know it's only one broker but it's useful as an indicator of seeing if people are buying shares to short. Why would anyone short it that much at the announcement of really good board of directors news and pretty good holiday sales? To stop momentum of course! I Just wondered what they paid and hope it's a lot!
