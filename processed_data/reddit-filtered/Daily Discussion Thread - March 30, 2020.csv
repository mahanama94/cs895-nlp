This is a ~20% rally (much like 220-265). Then begins the steep drop to even lower lows. Looking at the graph, each one of those days is just a candle. For us emotional bears, each day of what will be remembered as a mere candle 10 years down the line is full of mockery by bulls, seeing your life's savings evaporate, and feeling like an idiot. Point being, a day feels a lot longer and a lot more significant if you're not only living it but also participating in one of the most autistic communities to ever grace the internet. Long dated put holders: remember how quickly the sentiment flipped. It can flip back. Short term put holders, I'm sorry.

Edit since I don't want to appear like I think 2008==2020:

I'm not trying to directly compare the two crises, but rather provide perspective on the feeling of five days on a chart vs. living them and participating in this shit show we love to hate. Fake rallies only reveal themselves to be fake after they are over, and we don't have Doc Brown on our side.
