1589452257.0,2020-05-14,wallstreetbets,fqlartb,"It is three things mostly, pedigree, the story, and track record.

The pedigree is the first thing people see, your bio.  Where you went to school and who you learned under.  If you were at Goldman on a trading desk anyone would give you money for about two decades.  The bloom is finally off that particular rose.  Were you an analyst at a big firm?  Did you have buy/sell discretion?  Study under a respected quant at a good PhD program?  These things still carry weight.

Track record is obvious.  If you don't have the pedigree, you need the track record.  At least three years and audited.  

The third is the story.  This is where people bullshit a lot.  Why does your strategy work?  Bonus points if it is something that no one can understand because clearly you are smarter than them.

But the easiest way to convince randoms to give you money to trade is by already having had randoms give you money to trade in the past.  Even if you lost money every time.  If you have the pedigree and a story and other people have trusted you in the past... you'll be able to get people to give you money again.",t1_fqla43p,17
