I own a restaurant and my orders for the last 2 months were about 15% of normal. But I just places a reopening order that was 120% of normal, replacing things that were trashed/donated/went bad when we closed down. Everyone I know in the business is placing huge orders right now. Prices are way up, so they are going to post big revenue numbers next earnings. Choice ribeye (my biggest item, cost-wise) is sling for $12.50/lb right now, it usually sells for about 8.50. Same for choice tenderloins. Produce is up, a case of potatoes went from 17 to 24.

Revenue will probably not get to pre-covid numbers because q2 will include some covid shutdown time, but it'll be a larger than expected jump from q1 and July will be a huge upward trend.

The July upward revenue trend is gonna be more restocking perishables than a return to business as usual, but that won't matter if you time it right.

USFD 8/20 30C is super cheap right now, and I bet it's at least $5 ITM by the end of July. I think this is the closest thing to a 10 bagger I've come across yet.",t3_gsq9va,26
