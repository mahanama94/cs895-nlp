#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 




#____________________


Asian markets faced selling pressure today, mostly playing catch-up with Europe overnight and future drill


**India** down 0.87% 

**Hangseng**  up 0.59% 

**Nikkei** down 0.78%


#_____________________



Europe is still under pressure and is testing its most recent support

**Dax** down 0.83% 


**CAC40** down 1.14%


**FTSE** down 0.24%


#_____________________


**Dow futures** (25,726.0) -44.0(-0.17%)

#____________________

Global markets, even tho some indices are a bit down are still in a bullish trend, to summarize, the earlier resistance has become support and we are strength checking this support

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

The spy rally has been very intimidating in recent weeks, but we have to understand and accept the fact the major leg down and major leg up is over, so we have to change our mindset rather than chasing the past to repeat

We have been flat for the month, this brings in a period of many trades with small profit rather than big few trades

Weekly support is 305 and 308 and resistance at 314 and 320

#personal bias is that today we will trade between 310 - 316 hoping for 310 to become a psychological support

We expect 314 to become a strong support in the long term, but currently we are testing this level so we have a close eye on how the market is behaving at 314. For now market is contracting and expansion phase is not at sight.

**Please don't hold positions overnight and recommend to do intraday cause market is consolidating and is not showing signs of expansion**

#____________________


**Longterm** : Nasdaq 10k support is a very strong psychological support, usually when such strong support emerges taking long term trades gets comfortable, seeing spy 300 and Nasdaq 10k, it seems to have become a strong market with less of a downside, thus recommend to load quality stocks in SIP mode to benefit the volitality



#____________________


**Random tip for the day** : ""intelligent people are people who learn from their own mistakes, wise people are those who learns from others mistakes""



#____________________

**Spy Pre-market**  (313.51) −0.27 (0.086%)
