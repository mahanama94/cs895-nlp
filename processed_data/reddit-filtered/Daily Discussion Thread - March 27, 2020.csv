You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have two ventilators, and now all of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Can we order 30,000 ventilators?’”

""The president’s comments came shortly after the New York Times reported that the White House had abruptly called off a plan to announce this week that General Motors and Ventec Life Systems would be partnering to produce as many as 80,000 ventilators, citing concerns with the deal’s $1 billion price tag.""

DHR is a health science conglomerate, their subsidiary (one of the bigger contributors) just got FDA approval for a 45 minute covid test. It’s a printer cartridge set-up but their machines are pretty cheap and widely fielded, tests start shipping March 31st. 

Also on March 31st they are expected to finalize their acquisition of GE’s health sciences division which is (was) one of GE’s few winning divisions. Everything I’ve read and every analyst seems to say DHR is getting a good deal from GE and a at a steep discount. 

DHR is pretty low volume and I got shaken out at 20% profit because I couldn’t handle the low volume and large bid-ask spreads of course the next day the calls caught volume and shot up. 

I’m done with it but if you wanted to go decently far out on something survivable and well positioned, look at DHR.

Fuck it and fuck you maybe it’s shitty DD I don’t fuckin care I’d rather people write shit like this  rather than the same corny jokes over and over. I’ll probably lose all my money on spy today so fuck everyone money is a construct I hate you all but thank you for your time.",t3_fpv2fn,20
