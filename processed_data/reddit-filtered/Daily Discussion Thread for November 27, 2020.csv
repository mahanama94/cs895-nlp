Could be a 10x and it’s only 3x so far. I’m taking a shit so excuse my math but I think around $65 makes PLTR a $100 billion market cap. I really think that’s where it’s heading and a good chance that happens before the lock up period ends. Then I see Peter Thiel (the gay lover of my dreams) announcing an extension on the lock up causing the stock to soar even more. Next comes news about all the new government contracts and it goes fucking mental again. Then my sexy ass verse top says they need to do a stock split. By this point everyone who shorted the company is homeless but we rich PLTR holders donate to food drives and shelters to help them out.
