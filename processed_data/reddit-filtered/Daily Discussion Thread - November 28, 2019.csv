""Currency manipulator"" is a designation applied by United States government authorities, such as the United States Department of the Treasury, to countries that engage in a certain degree of currency intervention, a monetary policy in which a central bank buys or sells foreign currency in exchange for domestic currency, generally with the intention of influencing the exchange rate and commercial policy. Policymakers may have different reasons for currency intervention, such as controlling inflation, maintaining international competitiveness, or financial stability. So far United States has controlled worldwide economy and has been biggest manuputor of all countries. In many cases, the central bank weakens its own currency to subsidize exports and raise the price of imports, sometimes by as much as 30-40%, and it is thereby a method of protectionism.

If you agree with the ETFs goals and objectives and think that the reorganizing helps to better align it with such goals then it's nothing to worry about. This reorganization is very common with weighted ETFs. Say that AAPL can only represent 10% of the ETF, then if AAPL price were to double, the fund would have to reduce its holdings of AAPL if nothing else in the fund rose in value, simply to keep in line with its goals and objectives / purpose.",t1_f8z7yge,2

Shorts for small pull back. All CRISPR companies. Less risk to just buy 2020 calls and hold.

Align, bio rad, thermo fisher scientific, jnj if it pulls back 2%, EXAS calls if it holds above 80 by Tuesday. BMY all day everyday (would see if it dips to 55 but I highly doubt it, I’m long 2021 calls). Pfizer might be the most undervalued and I’d say it needs about 20% to be at value. Good bump with Pfizer and their new drug with Antares we still waiting on (could be at conference next week). Smaller newer pharma I’m not super comfortable recommending yet. Still in process of stealing their unreleased journal articles

AbbVie, gilead, Abbott might be a nice grab if it drops. I’d wait for any to pull back then go long. Pharma has been running hard past two months so I’d be careful
