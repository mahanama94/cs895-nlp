1572294410.0,2019-10-28,wallstreetbets,f5mworo,"Welcome to another week and more **Magical Crayons TA**!

If you're wondering how TA has been doing lately, here's a screenshot of price action against trendlines I drew about two weeks ago. [What you see is that we hit upward momentum trendlines nearly on the button every time at open.](https://imgur.com/g3tDJ1P) So if you aren't convinced the algos are controlling the market I hope this gives you some idea of what's going on. Everything is pretty manipulated and bullshitty without volume.

As I predicted last week at closing of market, [cracking of 302 led to a runup towards 304](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dn2wfh/weekend_discussion_thread_october_2527_2019/f587n8x/). We didn't hit 304 but given the hopium of the market, the performance of AAPL and FOMC would well push us there and to 305. Current trends suggest we could hit 305 tomorrow, but given Google's earnings, I suspect we are more likely to trade flat but above the 303 range until news is released. 

For bears I have more bad news, which is these gap ups make more technical supports for the market. Expecting an intraday plummet to 290 to save your terrible timed puts is basically impossible. What it does suggest though is that if we start dropping there should be plenty of time to pile in. If you're bearish, you should be watching for a collapse of the 300.8 mark. That is a strong support that took SPY over a week to finally break. If it loses that support, we probably visit 298-297 fairly quickly, and if that collapses 295 is going to hit like a truck.

So all that being said, the tl;dr is that market is run by robots, you should touch yourself responsibly, and as always, may tendies bless your portfolios.",t3_do7bfc,11
