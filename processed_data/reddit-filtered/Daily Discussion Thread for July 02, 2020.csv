#____________________


Asian markets are rallying hard, some of them have broken their intermediate resistance and giving a Bullish stance over all


**India** up 1.2% 

**Hangseng** up 2.72% (was closed yesterday that's why dong rally)

**Nikkei** up  0.11%


#_____________________



Europe indices are in a similar scenario like Asian market and are giving Bullish vibe too

**Dax** up 1.59% 


**CAC40** up 1.39%


**FTSE** up 0.71%


#_____________________


**Dow** futures (25,821.0) +246.0(+0.96%)

#____________________

Global markets are in general trading in a range determined by the past weeks action but respecting their support and bouncing back along with breaking short term resistance makes it bullish overall

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

Classic trend is your friend case thus we are avoiding to take any short position and are adding longs on dips, short chart suggests that we have transitioned from sell on rally to buy on dipa


Major support is still 305 and 307 and resistance is at 314 and 320,


#Personal bias is that we will trade today between 307 - 314 with an expectation that 307 becomes a short term support


Highly recommend to the people talking longs today to have you stops at 305, as breaking 305 would invite 300 again

#____________________


**Longterm** : for long term investing we keep an eye on Nasdaq charts and were skeptical when Nasdaq was below its 10k psychological support, but sirprisingly that support is reclaimed and we are currently well above 10k, 10k psychological is likely to stay in the long run this we recommend to go long using SIP mode to benefit volitality

(Alert : avoid Russel stocks cause the economic condition most likely will make big companies bigger and will wipe out small companies, the directional difference between Nasdaq, Dow, S and p and Russel is likely to continue )


#______________________

Even after the support of 300 being respected, we are relatively flat for past month, highly recommend to book profits on upper end of ranges, or at least pushing your Stop losses if riding all the way

1.	The Use of Metrics That Ignored Cash Flow. Many analysts focused on aspects of individual businesses that had nothing to do with how they generated revenue or their cash flow. 
2.	Significantly Overvalued Stocks. In addition to focusing on unnecessary metrics, analysts used very high multipliers in their models and formulas for valuing Internet companies, which resulted in unrealistic and overly optimistic values. Although more conservative analysts disagreed, their recommendations were virtually drowned out by the overwhelming hype in the financial community around Internet stocks.
