Asian markets even tho not up biggly have managed to close above their significant resistance going into the weekend


**India** up 0.5% 

**Hangseng** up 0.99% 

**Nikkei** up  0.72%


#_____________________



Europe indices are facing selling pressure but have managed to hold itself at it's resistance, most likely a test of upward resistance period

**Dax** down 0.62% 


**CAC40** down 0.99%


**FTSE** doen 1.18%


#_____________________


**Dow** futures (25,679.0) -80.0(-0.31%)

#____________________

Global markets are in general trading in a range determined by the past weeks action but respecting their support and bouncing back along with breaking short term resistance makes it bullish overall, test of upward resistance makes a zone of no trade, trade will be triggered on rejection or break on resistance

#Trade setup for today

Fed is trying to flatten the curve for its balance sheet. The only explanation for this action is inflation. Gold is already giving a signal that high inflation might be coming soon due to infinite QE.

However Mnuchin has a bazooka that he didn't use it yet, not sure what Mnuchin's plans are. Treasury is sitting on a lot of cash: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDTGAL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDTGAL)

e.g. go to r/investing, r/economy, etc and ask about what USD/stocks/bonds/etc might do over the next few months and you may hear exactly what you'd expect to hear from the extremes; well-studied vs complete fucking morons.  The well-studied are showing themselves wronger-n-a-muhfukuh in this market and the morons are either lucky / unlucky.

Here you'd hear from complete fucking morons, financial savants, the well-studied, retards, shills, the deliberately duplicitous, jokesters, well-meaning dorks, etc.  We all run rampant.  But, *but* the actual answers to shit seems to be found on WSB more often than other places..the trick is learning how to parse things and figure that out.  Some things can seem really compelling with the walls of words, nifty charts, references to crotch-indicators (DIX, et al), etc.  WSB pushes motherfuckers to figure out how to *disprove* shit we see because we never know if the person is bullshitting us, are well-intended, or just having a manic episode.  Posts in other subs are typically made in good faith, even if it's complete shit.  In that event, people invariably come along and shoot it to shit with reference to its book-learnin' accuracy, which we know ain't cutting it.

>  
>  
>  
>(Bloomberg)--From a 2,997-point rout in the Dow to two 9% single-day rallies in the S&P 500, the 2020 stock market has served up a raft of tantalizing sessions for would-be market timers. Hours came and went in which whole years could be made or lost. But for all the dizzying turbulence, it’s worth noting that the S&P 500 is nearly flat for anyone who sat tight and held through the chaos. Mistakes stand out in an environment like that -- the back-breaking costs of even a few wrong moves in a market as turbulent as this one. Maybe volatility is the time for active managers to shine, but the downside of getting it wrong has rarely been greater.  
>  
>One stark statistic highlighting the risk focuses on the penalty an investor incurs by sitting out the biggest single-day gains. Without the best five, for instance, a tepid 2020 becomes a horrendous one: a loss of 30%.  
>  
>The exercise highlights the danger of trying to call the market’s peak, something that investors are feeling tempted to do now with the S&P 500 hitting a wall at the 3,200 level, coronavirus infections rising and the worst earnings season in a decade about to kick off. In a recent survey conducted by Citigroup, more than two-thirds of investors see a 20% decline in the market as more likely than a gain of a similar amount.  
>  
>“We want to be tactical,” Yana Barton, a fund manager at Eaton Vance Management, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “But the problem is, it’s easy to get out and you don’t know when to get back in.”  
>  
>However prudent it sounds, the cost of bearishness is exemplified by the hedge fund crowd, whose reluctance to embrace equity gains is one reason they’ve lagged behind the market. In perhaps the most famous case to date, legendary investor Stan Druckenmiller told television interviewers he was “far too cautious” and had made “all of 3% in the 40% rally.” Broadly, hedge funds that focus on equities were down 6.3% in the first half, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. That compared with a total decline of 3.1% in the S&P 500.  
>  
>Read: Druckenmiller Says He Was ‘Far Too Cautious’ During Rally (2)  
>  
>Still, the urge to take the money and run is understandable after the S&P 500 has rallied 40% from its March bottom, a pace of gains that eclipses any in nine decades. Profits are estimated to have plunged 44% in the second quarter, billions of dollars in buybacks are shelved and the stay-at-home trade is back in vogue. But economic data from housing to employment is improving, retail investors are warming up to stocks and the Federal Reserve pledges indefinite support.  
>  
>With the number of 2% days piling up for the S&P 500 at a pace not seen in decades, the halfway point of 2020 might look like a great time to pack it up and go home. Looking back, on the other hand, one had to have perfect prescience to have made a timing strategy work any time up to now. The benchmark dropped more than 5% on five sessions, four of which occurred in March. The same month also accounted for four of the five biggest gains, totaling more than 900 points.  
>  
>“There were no flashing signals that those were the days that were going to see huge upside,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. “If you look back, they are unexpected. We get some of the biggest rallies on those unexpected days and so if you’re timing the market and you’re out of them, you’ve missed out on all of the rally really.”  
>  
>Sell high and buy low. It’s investing 101. But an ill-timed decision to do either can open the door to career-threatening pain. Getting out at the top may seem like the way to maximize returns. But over the past century, the S&P 500 had suffered 13 bear markets before this year, with all of them seeing losses fully recovered and the index eventually exceeding its prior peak by an average 68%.  
>  
>“People are always hopeful that they can time the market, and most people try and time the market based on emotion rather than logic,” said Olivia Engel, chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors’s active quantitative equity team. “From a couple of decades of investing, I would say that timing the market is just really hard and if it was easy, we’d all be very rich.”  
>  
>**As hard as it is, that hasn’t stopped investors from trying. Bears, in particular, haven’t given up on their calls for the S&P 500 to crash, potentially revisiting its March low.**  
>  
>If history is any guide, that scenario may not play out when stocks have gone this far in a rebound. During the eight market cycles since World War II, only once did the S&P 500 come within 5% of its bear market trough after three months had passed, as is the case now, according to a study by BMO Capital Markets.  
>  
>“You can’t buy it one day and sell it the next and think you can outfox the market. You can’t do that,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. “The way you make money in the market is you buy good companies and you hold on.”",t3_hkgjy6,10

1593797359.0,2020-07-03,wallstreetbets,fwtng1w,"The true number of unemployment is really around 21% or 31 million. So the numbers released yesterday are grossly underreported.

The way they tally the official unemployment number is only those who are actively seeking are counted. While those who are not which is a lot because being furloughed or work part time and are looking for full time work are discounted to not fit the official filing rules. 

This number also does not account for those who have also exhausted benefits or are still waiting to be approved.

Then you have to account for all the jobs who will never come back. Albeit through permanent closure of their company, or larger corps doing away with those jobs as a means of reducing expenditures. Then there are the jobs that will be considered redundant or nonessential.

The FED believes about 1/3 or 33% of businesses will be permanently shuttered due to the effect of covid lockdowns. With no strong support for small businesses coming from the FED or Congress in the stimulus packages.

So jobs will not be returning to a normal level for a few years. There are many articles and well respected economists who speak about this.
