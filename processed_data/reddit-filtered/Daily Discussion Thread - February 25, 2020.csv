Coronavirus is way more widespread than people realize but actually a much milder disease. You might even have had it and thought it was a bad cold.

Up until the last few days, most countries have only been testing people that traveled so they just haven't found that many cases. However, over the next week or two authorities will start testing more generally and they will find cases. Lots of them. The vast majority of these will be people in hospitals, the most sick, and quite a few of them will die.

This will create a huge media panic because it will make the case fatality rate look terrible. The authorities will also panic and lock shit down. This won't be good for stocks. However, about two weeks to a month later they will start to realize that basically everyone had the virus and didn't die. Buy calls just before this.

PTON looked like yesterday was suppose to be the nail in the coffin. There were so many puts purchased. MM's would've lost a ton of money if the puts had gone in the  money. So what happens? PTON rallies on an otherwise atrocious day for the market.

TSLA's max pain is 830 and there are like a billion puts at 700, so it seems, like someone posted in yesterday's thread, that based on the open interest of puts, that TSLA would stay between the 850-930 channel this week. And what do you know? TSLA looses one of its bulls with a downgrade from buy to hold last night and it is up 20 points from premarket. (he did raise the PT, so that helps but the downgrade prolly does not).

I'm holding TSLA calls and PTON calls. So I am not salty. I just want to understand better. Do MM have that much sway over the pricing of a stock?
