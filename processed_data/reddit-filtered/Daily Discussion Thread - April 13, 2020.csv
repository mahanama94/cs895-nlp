>The coming weeks will likely bring strikingly weak first-quarter corporate earnings results and deteriorating economic data due to the impacts of the pandemic. However, each of these batches of data will ultimately reflect already widely known weakness stemming from the global pandemic, and therefore not likely trigger a renewed, deeper sell-off in equities, the analysts said.

>‚ÄúWe expect investors will mostly ‚Äòlook through‚Äô reported 1Q results, which will capture only the start of shutdowns that began at the end of the quarter. In fact, many investors we have spoken with have discounted 2020 earnings altogether, and are focused instead on the outlook for 2021.‚Äù
