We're running a GME Earnings Megathread tomorrow...

...but if GME makes it to the top 3 most discussed stocks, then it will also be included in the popular ticker thread. (It's right on the cusp of #3/#4) 

I don't want to split the discussion, and I think you guys don't want that either. 

Should we make an exception and exclude GME from the most popular ticker thread if it makes it in, while keeping the GME earnings megathread?

Edit: Looks like the overwhelming majority want no split discussion, with GME Megathread and no GME in the Popular Tickers Thread. I'd love to hear any objections though!",t3_nv1518,1
