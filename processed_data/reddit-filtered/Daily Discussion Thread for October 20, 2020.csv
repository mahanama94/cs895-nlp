Foreclosure at all time highs. The animosity between the two parties made it so no stimulus could be passed. And this stalemate lasted 16 years. 

But today. 

Today the fair Mrs. Pelosi said she is hopeful of the stimulus finally passing. Although she is waiting for indication from the Majority Leader McConnell. Little did Pelosi know if McConnell were still alive, he would by 146 years old. 

Luckily, the deadline of 10/20/2020 has now been extended to 10/27/2036. We are hopeful.",t3_jemmh3,8
