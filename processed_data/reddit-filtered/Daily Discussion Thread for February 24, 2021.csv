I have come to the conclusion that I should just buy a big ass dartboard, print tickers for every symbol on the NYSE and then just throw darts at it a few times a week so I can lose money that way.

It sounds a lot more fun tbh. Maybe I could throw a blindfold into the mix just to make sure I don’t start actually trying to aim for shit to affect results.

If this post gets a hunnid upvotes I’ll actually do this with a few grand but I have a feeling sourcing a big ass dartboard will be hard.

Edit: Since I am now legally obligated to actually do this, should I stick with the dartboard thing or pivot to leting my Welsh Corgi pick the stocks by putting treats under cups with tickers printed on them? Think the dog thing could be more entertaining from an anticipation aspect.",t3_lra5cg,306
