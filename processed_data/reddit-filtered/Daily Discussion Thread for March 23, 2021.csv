1616496690.0,2021-03-23,wallstreetbets,grwy42f,"Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street. Small caps are seeing most of the selling, with the Russell 2000 down 1.5%. Tech stocks are in the least bad shape so far, with the Nasdaq down 0.4%. Dow and S&P are both down 0.5%. That‚Äôs as of 0630.

GameStop earnings after the close could provide a welcome respite for all this Fed talk. Will let you guys deal with that here.

Other than that it‚Äôs all about the Fed. We do also have Treasury Secretary (and former Fed chair) Janet Yellen testifying alongside Powell today. That testimony has already been released and it sounds like a marketing pitch for the Biden administration, as would be expected.

Not sure if the Treasury Secretary will take questions from lawmakers. Not sure it will matter. Powell stuck to his script yesterday, as expected. Bonds rallied a bit on this news.

We‚Äôre left with a market looking like it‚Äôs still very much struggling for direction. Not sure how much sense that makes considering what‚Äôs going on with the big picture ‚Äî reopening and vaccines, etc. Maybe it‚Äôs concerns about the coronavirus variants or the efficacy of the vaccines.

On the line was Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive of online pet supplies retailer Chewy who is now leading GameStop's push into e-commerce. Cohen was responding to an email Titus had sent 12 hours earlier to more than two dozen GameStop executives and board members.

""NOBODY has attempted to respond except a muddled voicemail with no distinguishable callback number or extension. E-commerce requires a customer support team and processes that are responsive,"" Titus wrote.

""I just got your email, I'm so sorry this happened. Let me get to the bottom of this,"" Cohen told Titus.",t3_mbb9n8,182
