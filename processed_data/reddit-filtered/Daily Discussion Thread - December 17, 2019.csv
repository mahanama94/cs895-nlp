Then I discovered shorting, and realized that you could make money when stocks went *down* as well.

Then I discovered options, and learned that you could make money regardless of how stocks moved. If they went up, you could make money. If they went up then down, you could make money. If they went down, you could make money. If they traded flat, you could make money. If they went up-ish but not too up, you could make money. It literally couldn‚Äôt go tits up, I thought. There‚Äôs literally no way you could lose money. No matter what a stock did, you could configure an options position to profit bigly from it.
