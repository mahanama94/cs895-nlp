The U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency half-percentage point interest rate cut Tuesday in a bid to protect the longest-ever economic expansion from the spreading coronavirus. ‚ÄúThe coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,‚Äù the Fed said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point.‚Äù The central bank also said it is ‚Äúclosely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.‚Äù The vote for the emergency cut to a range of 1% to 1.25% was unanimous. The Fed also said in the statement that the ‚Äúfundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.‚Äù The Fed acted hours after Powell and finance chiefs from the Group of Seven nations said they would ‚Äúuse all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks.‚Äù That echoed a statement Powell made on Friday.

I am definitely going to have to take a week long break in a couple months. Sleep for a couple days, go on a binger for a couple more, and sleep the remaining days after that. Then I should be reset and ready to go again. 

On the plus side, in years past I would habitually waste my days away (I have a night job) and sleep in until the afternoon, but with activity in the markets the last year or two, I have become much more regular and once again developed a more diurnal schedule.

Cutting interest rate is supposed to stimulate demand. When it's cheap to borrow money, companies and consumers increase their spending. 

Consumers go out and buy 0% car loans, and buy their 5th 70"" TV on a ""lower"" interest credit card. This increase spending prompts the companies to buy more equipment, and their decision is made even easier because of the lower interest rate, and thus the companies produce more cars and TVs for the American consumers.

That's grossly generalized consumption cycle. Now what the fuck does this virus do? It's going to make people scared of living their life. Already some areas on the west coast people are starting to stay the fuck at home.

We were already below where rates should be.  If rates were to be economically neutral, they should have been over 2% going into today, but they weren't...  We were already in an economically supportive rate posture.  If it isn't already clear, the Fed is just supporting asset prices at this point.

A 0.50 cut would have made sense if they hadn't already given 3 0.25 cuts last year.  The economy was already as juiced as it needed to be heading into this virus disruption.

So yeah, nobody believes this rate cut is temporary in any sense of the word because there's no way the market will price in rate hikes at any point in the next year.

This may end up working out and the S&P/Dow/Nasdaq hit ATHs in the next few months, but for the long-term, this is just another reckless decision.  We're going to have few tools to fight the next recession other than QE/outright asset purchases.",t3_fct06c,12

Lowering rates lowers the cost of borrowing money, across all segments of the economy, from corporate debt to small business debt, from student loans to home mortgages.

Why lower rates now?  In times of economic crisis, large, small, and start-up businesses all alike will borrow money in order to stay afloat.  By reducing rates, you make it easier for those companies to ""keep their head above water"".

This isn't being done to support asset prices.  It's being done to support businesses.

The market is fucking crashing, because this rate cut is an acknowledgement by the Central Bank that *things are going to be fucked* (economically speaking).  It really is just a flu with a higher fatality rate.  It isn't going to end the world.  BUT it is going to stick a dagger in the back of the world economy.
