1577316880.0,2019-12-25,wallstreetbets,fc1f41g,"That's a fair point - and with NKTR I'm thinking long term.  The other 2, I'm not considering long term holds.  The adynovate wasn't exactly ground-breaking.  There were already plenty of other drugs doing basically the same thing.  The only thing adynovate offered was an extended half-life.  Not exactly note-worthy when several other options exist - so that particular drug although approved - was a dud.
The Naloxegol was approved open label, but the clinical trials weren't overwhelmingly positive.  21% experienced abdominal pain.  Not good.  Also, this wasn't exclusive to NKTR.  They work with a lot of other companies who sponsor, or co-develop drugs.  Movantik was attached to a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca.
This current drug from NKTR (NKTR-181) is wholly owned by the company.  Not only this, it appeals to a wide range of prescribing doctors who are taking heat from prescribing pain medication in the current opioid crisis.  This drug offers pain relief without the euphoria and therefore will decrease potential abuse problems.  Although the adcom was delayed (for whatever reason) - it's being fast tracked by the FDA.  For reasons just beyond this product, IE: several other drugs in phase1/2 trials, partnerships with other big drug names, asset growth, etc... I'm bullish long term here.  I think it's a great growth company that should be fairly valued currently around 31-$35.  Just my opinion on it anyways.  I'm going to be buying and holding since I feel the potential is very high for growth in share price.  Hope this helps.  :)",t1_fc1e1jr,2

I love you but if you are trading options and you don't think you can afford a cup of SBUX then you should not be trading options no matter the cost.  I am guessing you take a very conservative approach and you do not have a lot of liquid funds available when your account is active and you are holding a few positions.  This is a sure way to lose all of your money.  So buy all the SBUX you want and all the vacations to the caribbean you can because that is the only way you win at this game.  I promise.,t1_fc1cne2,1
