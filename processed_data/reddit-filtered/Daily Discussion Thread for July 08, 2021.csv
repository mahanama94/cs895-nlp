1. Popeyes garbage can around 1:00-3:00 is PRIME since most people order large amounts of food at lunch and can’t finish. You will get the most meat during this time. Also lots of fries there as well and biscuits.

2. Try the local shelter asking for food, cons are the line being long.

3. I typically enjoy spending $1 for a box of cookies. Calories are there to maintain a 2k calories/day.

4. Another popular spot is your local all you can eat sushi spot. A lot of the waste at the end of the day or mid-lunch shift is thrown into the garbage along with foods that people can’t finish. Prime time is 2-3pm and 8-9pm. Popular items include leftover rolls, general tao chicken and stir fried noodles that people can’t finish.
