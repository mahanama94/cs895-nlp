#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 

#____________________

Asian markets take a temporary halt from the rally

Today they are slightly red

India down 1.6 %

Hang seng down 0.5%

Nikkie down 0.07%

#_____________________


Europe indices are facing more pressure than Asian counterpart

Dax down 2.2%


CAC 40 down 1.9 %


FTSE down 2.17%


#_____________________


Dow trading at 25766  being 0.97 % down


Global markets today are down but not giving a Bearish sentiment on long charts as these pull backs are small when compared to the rally they had


#____________________


Trade setup for today

Spy much likely will take halt from its past rally but there is no Bearish scenario bets to play as we are expecting flat session



Support has shifted from 305 to 309 after the recent weeks action but only time will tell strength of this support



315 comes out to be a surprising new resistance coming from this week's price action



Personal bias is that 315 will be taken out but not in short span




#There is no clear trend for bearish or Bullish scenario today, thus will not participate in derivatives today on intraday basis, but will try out a long play on taking a bullish bet at 310 for long calls to hold over night



Spy continues to to trend upwards in long chart  thus not looking to get involved in bearish bets till 320, reversal or breaking of 320 will decide next direction



#Todays recommendation is to avoid any intraday trade as lower end of spectrum will be tested, will wait to see a trend to form 


#____________________




Long term : as usual, major indices are on uptrend with vix making new lows on long charts this the recommendation stays the same, go long using it SIP strategy to benefit the current volatility 

#_____________________


Random tip for the day : ""not having any position is also a position""


#_____________________

#Spy pre Market : 309.24 (−2.81) (0.90%)
