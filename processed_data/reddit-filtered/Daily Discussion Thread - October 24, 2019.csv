As you have all figured out, it is probably 99% algos running the market because as I predicted the [past](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlxo0i/daily_discussion_thread_october_23_2019/f4wus95/) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dlgbuh/daily_discussion_thread_october_22_2019/f4s51p5/) Magical Crayons TA, tickling of 300.1 led to a stupidly quick gap fill to 300.5. That sort of behavior and speed at those exact ranges is just too fucky to call anything else but algos dicking around. 

With no more nearby gaps to fill, today the market will likely maintain a slow steady climb in the direction of its resistance of 300.7, which it has challenged a few times today and gotten rejected, and a rising support of 299.7, where it will fight to stay above.",t3_dmet1g,5
