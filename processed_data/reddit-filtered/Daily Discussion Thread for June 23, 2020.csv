Some Asian markets are making new highs after the crash 

Today they are fairly green

India up 1.5%

Hang seng up 1.5%

Nikkei up 0.5 %

#_____________________


Europe are rallying higher

Dax up 2.7 %


CAC 40 up 1.7 %


FTSE up 1.1%


#_____________________


S and p futures trading 0.8% higher at 3135


Global markets today are giving a Bullish sentiment overall and are currently extending gains


#____________________


Trade setup for today

Spy continues to indicate higher support continuing the bullish sentiment


Support has shifted from 305 to 309 after the recent weeks action


There is no real ressistance till 320



#Personal bias suggest that we will be trading from 310 - 315 range today with a view to load long position each time spy gives an entry in 310ish range with a tendency to take that position overnight


Spy continues to to trend upwards thus bearish bets are off the table untill clear rejection of 320


Consolidation was noticed each time nasdaq touched 10k, consolidation zone was 9500 - 10000, charts are indicating that consolidation is over and a new up move is on the cards, this is one of the prime reason for taking long position overnight as 10000 has turned it to become psychological support, this may help in holding all other indices 


#____________________



Long term : as usual, major indices are on uptrend with vix making new lows on long charts this the recommendation stays the same, go long using it SIP strategy to benefit the current volatility
