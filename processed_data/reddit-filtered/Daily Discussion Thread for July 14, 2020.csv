**Asian markets** rejected their long term resistance hard and that too very sharply, it got KO'd to it's nearest support and are red today


**India** down 1.81% 

**Hangseng**  down 1.14% 

**Nikkei** down  0.87%


#_____________________



**Europe markets**  rejected their resistance too yesterday and just like Asia has grabbed nearest support for help

**Dax** down 1.51% 


**CAC40** down 1.71%


**FTSE** down 0.24%


#_____________________


**Dow futures** (26,116.0) +148.0 (+0.57%)

#____________________

**Global markets**  all together said ""wait a minute"" and started behaving like insta thot, they rejected the long term resistance, it feels like global market wanna go up but wanna act hard to get 

#____________________


#Trade setup for spy  today

We were eye to eye with **320** yesterday but it got rejected Soo hard that we directly reached support of 314

Weekly ranges are, support at **307 and 310** and resistance at **314 and 320**

314 took so much efforts to break in the past 2 weeks when it was a resistance, this makes me believe that 314 will be a stronger support than we think

#Personal bias is that today we will trade between 312 - 320, hoping that 310 becomes a psychological support in intraday.

 Today we are gonna keep a close eye on 314 and how the markets react at this level

#____________________


**Longterm** : charts are showing sideways for a while now in long charts, seems like an accumulation period, we have built some strong support on our way here making it a good time to invest in SIP mode to benefit volitality
