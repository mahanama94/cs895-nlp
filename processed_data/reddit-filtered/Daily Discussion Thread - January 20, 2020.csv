The Dow opened the year at 12,459.54.6﻿ It rose despite growing concerns about the subprime mortgage crisis. On Nov. 17, 2006, the U.S. Commerce Department warned that October's new home permits were 28% lower than the year before.7﻿﻿8﻿ But economists didn't think the housing slowdown would affect the rest of the economy. In fact, they were relieved that the overheated real estate market appeared to be returning to normal.


The Fed began adding liquidity by buying banks’ subprime mortgages.9﻿ In October, economists warned about the widespread use of collateralized debt obligations and other derivatives.

As the year drew to a close, the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its growth estimate higher.10﻿ It said that the nation’s gross domestic product had increased by 0.5% in the third quarter. Its prior estimate said it had shrunk 0.5%. It seemed the U.S. economy could shrug off a housing downturn and banks’ liquidity constraints. The Dow ended the year just slightly off its October high, at 13,264.82.",t3_erbv24,5
