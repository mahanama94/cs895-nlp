Buy high, and sell low? Feeling like your world is crashing in? It’s not. You’ll be ok. Your risk tolerance is wild enough for you to be here. You will get through this. Take a break and come back fresh. Don’t chase your losses. Talk to some comrades here about how dumb your plays were. If you still feel like you can’t handle life; check out the resources below. There’s no shame in reaching out. My inbox is always open as well, though response time may vary. Worst case, there’s always bankruptcy, and even that isn’t the end of the world. 

Hang in there. Money is replaceable, you are not.
