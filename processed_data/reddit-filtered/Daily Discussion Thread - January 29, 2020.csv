step one:
make a list of ten stonks that you like and generally seem to go up

step two:
log into your tardyhood account and see which of those uppy stonks are red

step three:
if you can find no news in under 30 seconds that explains why the stonk red, buy wildly otm call options. stonk only caught small gay, will recover and you make ur tendis

if there is news, stonk caught big gay, stay bad no buy.

On the app store Teams has more downloads than Slack and 250k more reviews. Teams is one of Microsoft's fastest-growing offerings and my company recently switched to it.

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

Then when you get the hang of it and start making tendies on your SPY calls.

Go for Italian espresso machines that starts with an M and splurge on the > $2k espresso machines for the home. Better boilers, steamer and will make your BECKY spread her legs for you any day of the week. 

Any reputable coffee roasters are good. 

SBUX espresso beans are decent and bitter. Darker roast.
