I held the spread for an entire week before and then out of no where today, schwab restricted my account and forcefully sold the spread at a large loss.

I made a mistake buying the spread in the first place, but i am curious as to why there is 0 warning or barrier to prevent you from making trades that the broker itself is claiming to not allow you to make? 

It is just a little suspicious, the position exit costed me an abhorrent $60 in commission for no reason.

I am not saying i didnt fuck up, i am just shocked that robinhood has more mitigatory/preventative measures for options trading mistakes than a company that has existed for 50 years....
