2x 100% SPY calls. Once on 434 and again on 435. That means I’ve won every day this week except Thursday. Net up is around I don’t know 50-60k for the week. All spy. All calls except Monday or Tuesday put. 200k capital roughly. Just buying whichever direction. Always expire daily except mon or tues was for the next day. 


This continues my chronicle of using small amounts of initial capital and mostly going all in on spy daily calls. Up to about 200k now from about 9k. 


Goal is just to keep going all in but I have quickly pulled back as the all in went over 100k . That’s bad because my original plan was to just snowball it over 20 trades or whatever at 20% avg to $3-4m. Already have about $1m and so would then just retire.",t3_pz4ta4,10
