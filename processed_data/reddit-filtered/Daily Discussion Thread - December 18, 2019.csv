https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ec1szk/oc_i_got_annoyed_with_fedex_and_created_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Here is a summary someone gave about how crappy FDX's logistics are:

""I found out thanks to a chat with Mr. FedEx man--FedEx has three to four MASSIVE regional shipping centers that EVERYTHING must flow through regardless of the destination and based off your location/type of product ordered, might dictate where it goes. Doesn't matter if the source and destination are 5 miles or 5000 miles apart, it has to flow through these centers. 

When asking Mr. FedEx if he thought this was odd it didn't click at first. Then I asked, isn't it odd for my little 1lb package to take up space on your planes, trains, automobiles, (and for FedEx space is money) only to have it come ""boomerang"" back to me literally 2 miles away from your facility??? His response ""Ahhhhh it does seem strange...just always how we've done it"".

&#x200B;

...Then I found out the computer systems of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground don't actually talk to each other :)""",t3_ecb6pt,20
