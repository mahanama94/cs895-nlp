I’ve been bullish and playing TLRY since it was $9. TLRY has been making subtle jumps the deeper we were getting into a majority blue government. Now news is hitting about TLRY authorizations and partnerships, along with decriminalization and as far as possible legalization in the US. All of that on top of APHA merger.

TLRY is not spiking because of a squeeze right now. Yeah, short interest is building up, sure it might squeeze. But TLRY is genuinely building up value.

They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.
