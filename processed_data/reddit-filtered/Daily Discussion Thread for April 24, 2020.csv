1587731350.0,2020-04-24,wallstreetbets,fofaq0z,"A. El-Erian casually said something on CNBC yesterday about how, ""if the fed continues to buy stocks, it's going to lead to a 'zombie market.'"" The interesting takeaway from that is how he said it as if it's not only already happening, but as if it isn't completely illegal.

So obviously he knows things we don't. No one in any authority is going to just come out and say, ""yeah, we're backstopping the entire stock market. So don't worry, just jump in."" But clearly the fed is handing hundreds of billions in free 0%-interest cash to investment banks, MMs, hedge funds, primary dealers, etc. 

One theory is that all those banks & co. are undertaking a coordinated variation of what's called ""spoofing."" It's what that kid in London did from his basement on 5/6/10 to cause the Flash Crash, only they're doing it in the opposite direction (if I'm right & this is in fact what they're doing). If let's say 6 or 7 of these banks were working together, with oh I don't know maybe $1.5T total (which is not as far-fetched as it may initially seem), timing all their moves, they could pull this off. If a fucking kid in his underwear sitting in his mom's basement could sink the entire fucking stock market with the click of a few buttons, I think Larry Fink, Steve Schwarzman, David Solomon, et al, with literally unlimited capital, could pull it off. Especially in an absurdly low-volume environment such as the one we're currently in.

To simplify, Spoofing involves flooding the system with kagillions of buy orders (in this case it'd be E-mini S&P futures), and canceling them at the last mili-micro-nano second.

This could be why the market keeps going up, or at least not plummeting, like we all know it should be. We're told that, ""the stock market isn't about the economy,"" and now we know it isn't about earnings, either. So what in the actual fuck is it about then?

Save the snark. It's just a theory. I'm not married to it, and my thumb hurts from tapping this out. My brain hurts from thinking about it.

1. tons of video platforms already out there (I had calls on google meet, go to meeting and some other I can even remember just this week). 

2. With twilio api I can build a high quality video chat app in like a month by myself... now scaling it to have millions of calls isn’t that easy but there’s plenty of companies capable or already doing it 

3. There is very low switching cost. It’s not like switching CRMs, or workflow apps or switching from running my company on Microsoft products to google products... you can literally move your organization from zoom to XYZ in 30 seconds

4. Microsoft will eventually have a product for this and every company running Microsoft products will use it (same thing that happened to slack)

-90% of published “estimates” get beat. It doesn’t mean that’s what people *actually* expected. 

-When a stock drops 35% in a few months, then has a bad earnings, that does not mean it is going to immediately drop again. In fact it could go up. This is not because “investors are retarded.”

-Earnings are almost always about something other than EPS and revenue. Forward guidance or industry-specific measures that don’t make the front page are far more important (for example, new users in social media)

-Even then, sometimes the price action is literally because big boys were just setting up algos to move in and out of a position where they knew there would be volume. May have jack shit to do with the report itself.

Every time I make a good move, no matter how smart I try to be about things the market finds new ways to fuck me and make me look like an idiot. The only way to win is to do what all the fucking boomers do and just ""buy and hold"".  


I thought I was so clever for riding puts down in March and being all slick hedging my 401k losses with big options wins, but my dumbass bought nothing at the bottom except a few hundred shares of shitty companies that haven't rallied at all during this 70% retracement from the lows.  


I could have been ""smart"" and bought some overvalued tech stocks like AMD with it's 100+ PE, SHOP with it's 200+ PE, or MSFT, which never even traded below June 2019 values. But I thought I was smarter than the boomers and wanted to only buy when good companies actually got cheap. Silly me. They will never be cheap while the boomers are alive.  


Back to being a wage slave with a decent paying tech job that makes me want to fucking kill myself every second of every day. I've wasted the money I've saved over the past 6 years working there by ""investing"" every penny I've saved and all of that money is now gone. I haven't done the math but probably close to 100k I've had saved over the years that is now worth 95 bucks. If I'd done the boomer thing they'd be worth closer to 300k.  


I am dumb. Everyone here is dumb, but I'm dumber than most. r/investing knows how to actually make money. The point of buy and hold, apparently, is to keep yourself from doing stupid things like ever taking your money out of the market.",t3_g75wz3,29
