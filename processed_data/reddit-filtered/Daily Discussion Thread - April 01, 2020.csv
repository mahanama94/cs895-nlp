1585755167.0,2020-04-01,wallstreetbets,fm4j7pz,"If you're expecting big unemployment numbers tomorrow, it might not pan out for your puts. Here's some local DD from NC -

I laid off 45 people when my restaurant was forced to temporarily close. 5 full timers and 40 part timers. Out of those 45, maybe 30 have filed claims. The remaining 15 are too lazy to bother getting free money. Seriously. The NC unemployment website is a disaster and it's taking people hours to get it to go all the way through the steps to file. 

Out of the 30 that have filed, I have received and approved 20 claims (I have to certify that they were laid off and not fired for misconduct or job abandonment to expedite their claims).

Out of those 20 claims I have approved, at least 12, including myself, have gotten delayed due to ""cannot verify social security number"". The people who are rejected this way are asked to take their social security card to the unemployment office in person (great for social distancing, right). Only two of the 12 have actually done this. 

So, out of 45 layoffs, only 30 (66%) have filed for unemployment, and only 10 (22%) have actually been approved for benefits. I don't know at what point they become initial jobless claims (is it when they apply, when they are approved, or when they actually receive a check). 

I bet this is a transparent attempt to show lower unemployment numbers. If this type of fuckery is going on in every state, the unemployment numbers are being VASTLY underreported.
