Choose an index. S&P500(SPY) or NASDAQ(QQQ).  
Ok if you can read you're doing great so far!  
Now, go back in the FUTURES chart of that index and look at where we rallied from, and look at where we sold. Play those levels. In and out, quick trades, take your profits. Or buy end of day and sell at open, accordingly.

^Updated ^to ^real ^time

#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 




#____________________


**Asian markets** , all 4 engines of Asian market are thrusting on full power leading to second consecutive days of biggly green today


**India** up 69.420 %

**Hangseng**   up 420.69 % 

**Nikkei** up 0.69 %


#_____________________



**European markets**  have broken their resistance finally and markets are showing similar sense of Asian joy today

**Dax**  up 4.20% 


**CAC40** up 6.90 %


**FTSE** up 69.69  %


#_____________________


**Dow futures** (69,420.0) +420 (+0.69%)

#____________________

**Global markets**  are biggly green today, many of them made new rally highs and are looking confident and creating global synergy with each other

#____________________


**Trade setup for spy  today**

Yesterday's spy action might look intimidating, but it is just a start of what's to come, when we said we are bullish for the entire week, we meant it.

Spy convincingly broke it's long term resistance yesterday, giving it a new territory to trade, an interesting point is that now we have transitioned from contractionary market to expansionary again and Nasdaq leading from front is always a plus

Weekly ranges are support at **690 and 420** and resistance is yet to be determined by the market

#personal bias is that we will trade between 420 - 690 today hoping that newly broken 324 resistance becomes an intraday support
 



#____________________


**Longterm** :  markets all over the world are showing strength, recommendation is still to pick stocks for long term prospect on dips in SIP mode to benefit volitality

#____________________


**Random tip for the day** : "" watch news for entertainment, not for DD ""



#____________________

**Spy Pre-market**  ( 420 ) + 6.9  (+0.89%)

**Crude oil** ( 42.17 ) +1.25 (+3.05%)

I looked through all the settings I could think of and nothing I tried would make submissions from certain people go through. Is reddit still shadowbanning people? Does anyone have any idea why a submission might say Removed on our end with no reason? It's not account age. The only thing I see is that some of the affected users say profane shit.
