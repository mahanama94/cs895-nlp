Do you guys use Stock, Options, Futures, Fundamentals, and Technicals flairs for looking through posts much? I'm looking at the Futures flair and it's just a pile of garbage.

I'm thinking the label ambiguity might be causing more trouble for us than it's worth. Why spend all day chasing cats into particular boxes? Maybe if we provide a better labeling scheme we'll get less nonsense and it'll be easier to deal with.

Consider posting a news story involving a company as a newer user. Is it Stocks since it's a .. stock? But you're buying options. You could use Options flair. Maybe it's DD because it's important information? If we had a News flair it'd potentially be a catchall for that without even having to have read the rules.

Maybe it just ought to be DD and Discussion for text-based posts. Gain, Loss, and YOLO for positions in various states. News for links to external sites that ostensibly have something to do with us.

You're left with pictures of charts that probably could go in a new flair called Chart, then any media that is left over would probably be a Meme, instead of how it is now where people just smuggle their memes past automod by posting them as Satire.

DD, Discussion, Gain, Loss, YOLO, News, Chart, Meme. Does that sound reasonable? Would anyone mourn the loss of our current scheme? If anything it'd be nice for what kind of equity it is to be another set of labels on top of whether it's discussion, link, news, etc, but we can't do that.",t3_kn09ji,34
