* The Chair will say some shit we don't care about. A couple others probably will too.

* Jpow will then take about 10 minutes to eli5 to these stupid bastards in congress what's going on in the economy. He'll talk about the good and the bad. And he'll take a few shots at congress for being the lazy bitches they are.

* The remaining 2-3 hours will be members of congress asking jpow stupid ass questions, most of which have nothing to do with him or the fed, but as always they try to rope our boy jpow into partisan bullshit, which he will have no part of. Both you and jpow will want to slit your wrists after about 5 minutes of this shit.

* He talks to the Senate today and the House tomorrow. It'll be more or less the same nonsense on day 2. Jpow will grit his teeth thru the entire useless process, nonchalantly jerking his dick under the table whilst fantasizing about printing more monies.",t3_ha16p4,196
