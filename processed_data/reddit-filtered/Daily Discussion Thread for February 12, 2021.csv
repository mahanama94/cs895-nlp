They created special ""Class F"" shares for the founders, such that the total of all class F shares at all times have 49.99999% of the voting power of all outstanding shares. That means the Founders can sell their shares without losing any voting power, and they can issue brand new shares as much as they want and Thiel, Cohen and Karp will always maintain full control. 

> Accordingly, our Founders will be able to achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings without diminishing their voting control.

They just crafted a way to get listed on the stock exchange while remaining privately controlled. What was the point of the DPO then? Just make employees happy?
