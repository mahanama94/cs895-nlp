This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be. He says ""U, for 'you'"" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.
  
  
All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, ""we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase  options with a $25,000 barrier to entry.""
  
You start weeping aloud,  you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, ""what's wrong my little X'√π3?""   
  
Suddenly you wake, you're in a pool of sweat, at first you panic about the new options policy, then you're filled with relief realizing that options aren't restricted it was all a dream.   
  
You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200,000% gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $900 and realize the options are actually $20 each. The best you can do is $900 TSLA weekly expiring around Christmas.

The time: February 2020. Covid had yet to come to American shores. The market was riding high and WSB was eatin' tendies... but many of us have lost money in recent days.How did this happen? By dreaming too low.

It's a lot like the story of America. 

The time: July 1969. The Russians had made a mockery of us. First sputnik, then the luna 2 probe. We were on the ropes, but did America back down? NO. We stood our ground, YOLO'd our taxpayer money into a space (SPCE) program and we planted our flag in the moon. THE MOON! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Now is our time. 

We might have our backs against the ropes. We might have made a couple bucks off of PLTR only to lose them the last couple days. But our Fight is not over. And just like the USA, its time again, to YOLO our accounts into SPCE. Let's see it break 40 lets see it go to the moon. Will you join me? You could be the next Neil Armstrong. The next Buzz Aldrin. Don't miss out. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
