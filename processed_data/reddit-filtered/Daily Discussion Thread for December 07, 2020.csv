This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be. He says ""U, for 'you'"" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.
  
  
All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, ""we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase  options with a $25,000 barrier to entry.""
  
You start weeping aloud,  you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, ""what's wrong my little X'‚àöœÄ3?""   
  
Suddenly you wake, you're in a pool of sweat, at first you panic about the new options policy, then you're filled with relief realizing that options aren't restricted it was all a dream.   
  
You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200,000% gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $900 and realize the options are actually $20 each. The best you can do is $900 TSLA weekly expiring around Christmas.

It's a lot like the story of America. 

The time: July 1969. The Russians had made a mockery of us. First sputnik, then the luna 2 probe. We were on the ropes, but did America back down? NO. We stood our ground, YOLO'd our taxpayer money into a space (SPCE) program and we planted our flag in the moon. THE MOON! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Now is our time. 

We might have our backs against the ropes. We might have made a couple bucks off of PLTR only to lose them the last couple days. But our Fight is not over.
