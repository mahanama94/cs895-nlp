As i kept returning more frequently this year, three letters kept catching my eye, g, m and e.  Then the first sky rocket to $400+ happened.  

I go home to my apartment and i'm telling my wife about it, our son(14) hears me and comes out from his room and says 'stonks'.  Thats it, thats enough for me, i'm gonna figure this shit out!  

About 4 business days later I have my first trader account with a broker app and a very modest balance.  We buy a gme share a couple amc shares and a couple clean energy type shares, clne was kinda looking interesting.  My son did all the purchases as i was at work and hes doing half his grade 9 at home, i thought it would be cool parenting to let him handle the dips and such since i didnt have anyone to show me that shit when i was his age (my dad was a drug traffiker).

Since then we have bought a few more amc (9) and one more gme (2) and a few more different cheaper than a dollar shares, we're holding until they reach astronomical levels and then we will sell 1 gme and 8 amc.  That is our families plan.

Why? These threads can be very manipulating. 
I often find myself picking up the general consens of these threads. This goes up and down. Very often I have a good feeling about something then I go into this thread read tons of negative comments and immediately feel like okay I better should not do this and that. So, i am a retarded idiot and of course you would think lol who cares about what they write here, many people do, they sort by new and read every comment and get too emotionally invested in this. 

Even now, people here talk like GME is dead after a heavy attack from which it recovered after like 20 minutes. While I thought before ""wow we are on the same level after yesterday"" I read some discussion threads and immediately feel like I missed the chance of my life and regret my decisions.

1615461210.0,2021-03-11,wallstreetbets,gqk7w2k,"For those new to whats happening:

70mil shares exist, 20 mil shares are institutional and untradeable. that 50mil left over (excluding naked shorts) is what is being fought over by the big guys.

The Short side is attacking the stock in a relatively smart way, getting it on the short restricted  list today rather than friday. If they can kill enough confidence, and fight a wall price at whatever undisclosed price they need it to stay below, friday when the Short Restriction is lifted they can attack even harder to shore up losses on options contracts for 3/12

What were are seeing is no doubt sell offs by BIG BIG money to crash price and recoup from the options market contracts. NOT HUGE RETAIL SELL OFF. We could never have this huge of an effect as what we are seeing today and and saw yesterday. were just smack dab in the middle of a battle between big boys with unfathomable money.

The upside is the Long Big Money is also likely waiting to see how much the short side is willing to let loose so they can buy it up. but timing is everything atm. that is why shorts were happy to see highs wednesday and no doubt planned for this to crash it wednesday. But, there is still many more moves to be made on both sides
