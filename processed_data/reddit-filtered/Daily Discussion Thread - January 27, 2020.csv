1. Jiangsu announced yesterday that work for the entire province (80 mil people), is to be cancelled until 8 Feb.

2. Shanghai municipality just announced a few hours ago the same, all work cancelled til 8 Feb (20mil people). 

3. We have Gubei province under complete lockdown.

4. Mongolia closed border with China. Feiji Islands and other small islands are thinking of doing the same after Feiji reported 4 infected Chinese. Turkemnistan or whatever the fuck is west of China has decided to block all Chinese as well.

5. Taiwan suspending ALL entry permit applications (visa) for Chinese citizens, even for those living abroad (HK, US, etc)

6. Surrounding countries China are discussing and assessing if they should close borders to China as well. 

7. The expected peak of the virus to hit April / May 2020, 700,000,000 infected (HongKong)

If correct, in approx 2 Weeks many cases will start being reported in Western countries. Then citizens will finally take notice, but it'll be too late by then lol

Think what this would do to the world economy. No production for another week in China. And who knows, for months to go. Good luck!

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.

***Tens of thousands likely infected now: HKU experts***

 Medical experts from the University of Hong Kong warned on Monday that governments should implement ""draconian measures"" to limit the spread of the new Wuhan virus, saying the number of cases is likely to be far higher than reported.  


The dean of the university's medical school, Gabriel Leung, said his team has estimated that as of Saturday, some 44,000 people in Wuhan alone were likely to have been infected by the new virus.  


Around 25,000 of these were likely to be sick, with the others only in the incubation stage and not yet showing symptoms.  


With the estimated infection figure drastically higher than the mainland's latest official tally of 2,744 confirmed cases – and infections now reported in around a dozen countries – the HKU experts said a global epidemic could be imminent.  


Leung said to date, the number of people catching the virus is believed to have been doubling every 6 days.",t3_eumj9a,8

Small observational study shows incubation likely 5 days, not 14: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext

Cities were locked down 5 days ago, so we will likely see a jump and then some sort of plateau of infection. Buying time for R&D for treatment.

Appears to be 1.4-2.5 R0 . 3+ does not seem plausible. 2.5 is assuming no precautions are taken.
