Top White House economist Larry Kudlow said        Friday a U.S.-China        trade deal is close, as talks between Washington        and Beijing        are in an ""intense"" phase. Speaking in a CNBC interview, Kudlow echoed        President Donald Trump's statements that the        administration will walk away if an eventual deal isn't good for the U.S.,        but said the economic-growth potential of an agreement could be        ""terrific."" Kudlow spoke following the release of the November jobs        data, which showed a much stronger-than-expected 266,000 positions added        in the month. ""America is working,"" said the National        Economic Council director. U.S.        stocks .",t3_e6xdf4,4
