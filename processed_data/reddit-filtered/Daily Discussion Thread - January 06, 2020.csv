Iran will not escalate via military attacks.

They would welcome further escalation from US as internationally people are already quite baffled by how audacious that drone attack was.

Iran said themselves US will feel the consequences of the attack for years to come - suggesting they'll just focus on the nuclear programme. Expect ICBM tests and increased uranium enrichment activity, but NOT attacks on US allies or vessels in the gulf.
