#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 




#____________________


Asian markets strongly rebounded their supports convincingly and stating clearly their intentions


**India** up 1.1% 

**Hangseng**  up 0.31% 

**Nikkei** up 0.4%


#_____________________



Europe is doing a good job by respecting it's support, and have reacted in similar fashion as asia

**Dax** up 1.21% 


**CAC40** up 0.066%


**FTSE** down 0.52%


#_____________________


**Dow futures** (25,892.0) -77.0(-0.30%)

#____________________

When global market all together have respected their supports and and rebounded it created a synergy of bulishnes, the strength and confidence is clear in the trend

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

For long time we have been observing the markets behavior at 314 level, it has been noticed that each time we touch or go below 314 there is a sharp upward rebound, this makes it very difficult to not be biased on upside

**Weekly support is 308 and 310 and resistance at 314 and 320**

So it's obvious that if 314 resistance is now behaving like a new found support we are most likely gonna test 320

#Personal bias today is that we will trade between 314 - 320 while taking a bias consideration that 314 has become the new 300 

320 test will be sooner than we can imagine if 314 will continue to be respects as it has been.

#____________________


**Longterm** : global market all together are showing strength, and same as before Nasdaq 10k support is a very strong psychological support, usually when such strong support emerges taking long term trades gets comfortable, seeing spy 300 and Nasdaq 10k, it seems to have become a strong market with less of a downside.

**Recommendation to invest in SIP mode as always to benefit the volitality**
