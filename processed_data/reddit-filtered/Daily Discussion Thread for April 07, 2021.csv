How is it that PLTR volume is always so damn high, and yet price movement is so damn flat? I‚Äôm strongly ‚Äúguessing‚Äù it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs an equal amount of buyers and sellers.

So if it‚Äôs not retail doing the selling, and the sell offs aren‚Äôt predominantly still due to company execs and long time shareholder holders....and institutions haven‚Äôt bought in to a massive extent (to sell)...is the flat price movement due to options trading? 

And, Everytime I check, the volume of calls being bought far exceeds puts being bought...wouldn‚Äôt that make the price rise?


What am I missing. Be as much of an asshole as you want but can someone please lmk for real what the deal is? They had two massive new contracts recently. I‚Äôd expect it to go up a little and establish a new baseline, instead of going up slightly just to go back down slightly.",t3_mlyq20,15
