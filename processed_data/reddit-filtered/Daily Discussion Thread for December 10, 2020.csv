On Tuesday, at the top, TSLA's p/e ratio was 1,287

1,287

Now some of you retards are like ""i dunno what that means"" but i'll fucking tell you what it means. It means when you buy a TSLA share, it would take 1,287 years of current revenue for TSLA to pay you back for that share you buy fucking today.

let me put that into fucking perspective baby birds. 1,287 years ago was the year fucking 733.

You know what was going on in fucking 733?

The fucking Arab-Byzantine Wars were raging in fucking Byzantine.

Some fucking Chinese dude was dreaming up the concept of gunpowder. But he fucking failed because this shit wasn't invented until like 100 fucking years later.

Some dude was being born who 15 years later would nut in some roman thot and make fucking Charlemagne.

And if that baby, who was to grow up and later nut out fucking Charlemagne, was like ""hey buy stock in my business,"" it would have taken until fucking today, in 2020, for that fucking stock to be worth face value.
