&#x200B;

Ocugen is a biopharma company that normally specializes in developing treatments for blindness. However, it was announced a couple days ago that they had reached a deal with Indian pharma company Bharat Biotech to be the exclusive developer/distributor for Bharat’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Covaxin, in the US market. It already has emergency approval in India and appears to be having success, while also holding some advantages over other vaccines on the market, most notably that it can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius.

&#x200B;

This news caused the stock to shoot up 70%+ since 2/2. I became interested in the stock for its future potential, since if it manages to win over significant contracts in the US it could propel the stock even higher, so I started doing my due diligence. In doing so I found something very odd. A few years ago this stock, which went from $1.70 to \~$3.50 in the past couple days, was worth nearly $150 in late 2018. Before that it was worth $500-600 back in 2015. The price of the stock steadily declined for a few years but was relatively stable from the end of 2016 to late 2018. But then, in September 2018, it fell off a cliff and in less than 6 months it tumbled nearly 170% by Feb. 2019 and never recovered. I’ve been trying to search old articles to determine what happened at that juncture but I’m drawing blanks. Did anyone else have their eye on this one or have any recollection about what happened during that time frame?",t3_lf9huy,13
