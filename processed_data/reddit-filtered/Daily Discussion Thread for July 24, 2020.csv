This is my first time batting a thousand for the week, increasing my account value by 24%. Including my April losses, I am now positive 35% for the year and up 65% since I started this strategy 13 weeks ago. 

Every play was short strangles, mostly on weeklies but on the occasional monthly (IBM, MTB). Not only did all positions end up closing positive, every *contract* ended up closing positive.

This makes 11/13 positive weeks, with 1 loss and 1 wash. Every week I am up, I skim profits to do fun things like pay bills and reset my account back to base. I am getting closer and closer to only having ""house money"" in my account.

Special thanks to IBM, LOGI, LLNW, SYF, COF, UAL, IRBT, SNAP, AAL, LUV, TWTR, MTB, SKX, and AXP.

Honorable mention to INTC. I almost sold a strangle Thursday, but I weighed against it due to low IV. That would have made the week a whole lot different.

https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/20/07/16763338/moderna-faces-hurdle-with-coronavirus-vaccine-as-court-refuses-to-invalidate-arbutus-patent

The Massachusetts-headquartered company’s contention that the ‘069 patent, related to the technology for delivering mRNA vaccines, owned by Arbutus described obvious concepts was rejected by an administrative court under the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday.

The patent is supposedly related to lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology, which helps the human body create its own therapeutic proteins.

A patent lawyer, Zachary Silbersher, told Reuters it was not clear if vaccines developed by Moderna, including the one for COVID-19, infringed upon the Arbutus patent, but efforts by Moderna to invalidate the ‘069 patent indicate that the biotechnology company sees it as an obstacle.
