#Its your boy chimpu back with daily updates and insights 




#____________________


Asian markets are hovering in a very tight range and it's getting confusing 


**India** down 0.42% 

**Hangseng**  down1.84% 

**Nikkei** down 1.06%


#_____________________



Europe is facing the same pressure too, this narrow range prevails in Europe but are light green today

**Dax** up 0.42% 


**CAC40** up 0.44%


**FTSE** up 0.69%


#_____________________


**Dow futures** (25,506.0) -65.0 (-0.25%)

#____________________

Global markets are tightly cealed to their support and to be honest even I don't know what to make of this

#____________________


#Trade setup for today

314 is the golden number that has been derived in this week's action, it has a simple back story that it was once the toughest resistance to break then we broke it, thought that it's the new support, but then we broke the support, in short spy is tied to 314 with miniature up and down at this level

Weekly support **308** and **310** and resistance **314** and **320**

Taking any trade while spy is magnet glued to 314 will be doing charity to theta gang

#Personal bias is today we will trade 310 - 316 considering that 310 turns out to become a psychological support in intraday

Keep a close eye whether there is a sharp reversal at 314 or a convincing break of it

**Till then we are not taking any trades and using this time to hoard long term stocks**

#____________________


**Longterm** : spy 300 and Nasdaq 10k will not be broken easily, but we are well above these levels with shaky resistance and supports, we won't recommend to go all in today but you can buy stocks in installments 

**Recommendation to invest in SIP mode as always to benefit the volitality**




#____________________


**Random tip for the day** : ""in stock Market buyer, seller and spectator all three are always unhappy, so learn to move on from your past action and focus on your next move""



#____________________

**Spy Pre-market**  (313.61) −0.77 (0.24%)

**Crude oil** (39.01) -0.61 (-1.54%)
