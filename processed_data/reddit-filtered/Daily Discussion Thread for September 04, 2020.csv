1) Always take back 100% of my original investment when an option is at least 150% ITM, the rest is house money I can afford to lose or profit from.

2) I will never hold through earnings again when the profit has already been priced in.  ZM was an anomaly, most stocks will dump hard no matter how much they smash earnings by.  Buy the rumor sell the news is now tattooed on my monkey brain.

3) I will not play weeklies.  Ever again.  Nothing is worth losing as much sleep as I did the last 2 weeks over these.  Especially on momentum stonks.  ETF monthlies or long calls may go up or down but at least I can rest my head at night knowing there‚Äôs enough equity and intrinsic value left in the asset to allow for corrections.

In short, these were expensive lessons but I am not out of this game by a long shot and I do believe over time they will pay my losses back 10 fold.

I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory.

As some one wrote below, it's only a loss if  you sell (or if closed out by the broker - hopefully we'll carry the memory of these 2 days, and not over-leverage).

Else, if something was worth buying at 498 or 135 or ..., it's certainly a buy at this mega sale. If it was not, and you were just hoping to leech off of someone else's foolishness (bigger fool...), then yes music does stop - every once in a while.",t1_g3zx327,11
