https://youtu.be/y5ar6E46Hio?t=283

Portnoy has his bad ideas out loud. Portnoy was also buddies with our deposed founder. The second he finds out about nerdcoins he has the idea to pump and dump them on his own audience. Mark Cuban showed up in /r/wallstreetbets (at the request of former scammer mods) to shill NFTs and decentralization too.

Weird huh? Remember this. It'll probably become clear within the next week or two why I'm starting to show you more of the truth of what happened. I offered the story to vice and others and they wouldn't commit to not including some scam crypto pitch, so I know which side they're on.

The above should make it less weirdly random and more suspicious that the Winklevii and Cuban were featured in GameStopped, or that the legacy media can't stop interviewing our deposed founder and showering him in money, deals, etc, despite literally being removed for scamming and also [harvesting emails to sell to scammers](https://i.gyazo.com/9e5589650d194d58e0638477b677f1a5.png) before being kicked out.
